Apple's earnings report shows why I always say \"own it, don't trade it.\" Where it has launched Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 sells better. High-margin services revenues was better. Mac better. Accessories better. Europe better. India better. Expanding gross margins helped make the numbers, too. Shares are up about 4% Friday.  2. China is still a question mark for Apple, though. Revenues down 11% there in the quarter. Apple Intelligence still needs government approval to launch. Rivals Huawei and Xiaomi can access the AI from buzzy Chinese startup DeepSeek. What can Apple get to reverse its fortunes in China? Will Baidu be its AI partner? 3. The U.S. government is looking into whether DeepSeek used third-parties in Singapore to acquire Nvidia chips that Washington has banned in China, according to Bloomberg News. Club name Nvidia says it plays by the rules in Singapore, and that its revenue from the island country does not indicate diversion.  4. We know Tesla, Club stock Meta and Oracle want all the high-end Nvidia chips they can get, even with DeepSeek's emergence. We don't know about Club names Alphabet or Amazon, which both report next week. What if one of the two says we are reassessing our orders for Nvidia's next-gen AI platform Blackwell? What happens to the stock? What if Amazon, another Club holding, says it's leaning into using AMD? I made a call on Nvidia stock for Club members yesterday.  5. Geopolitics remain part of the Nvidia dilemma. Does DeepSeek have a juicer that can make 10 glasses of orange juice out of a single orange, or does it have 10 government-subsidized juicers that it just won't tell us about? If it is 10 juicers, I worry that President Donald Trump will just ban all semiconductor exports to China.  6. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, currently set to take effect Saturday, may exclude oil, the president told reporters Thursday night. U.S. oil benchmark WTI was slightly higher Friday, to roughly $73  barrel. The U.S. dollar index strengthened, but it's still below its recent highs set earlier this month.  7. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all set to open higher Friday. Stock futures held onto their gains after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge matched expectations for December. The PCE index rose 0.3% month over month and, when excluding food and energy, 2.8% on an annual basis.  8. Intel showed some cost discipline and improved cash flow in its quarterly results. But the fourth quarter is typically strong for them, and there might have been some pull-through ahead of higher tariffs on Chinese imports. The PC market is weak. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo cut their price targets on the struggling chip stock. Shares added more than 1% Friday.  9. Atlassian shares jumped almost 20% on the back of a very good quarter. The company, which trades under the ticker TEAM, makes pure enterprise software that makes it easier to share\u00a0and simplify. Seems unstoppable. 10. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' non-opioid painkiller Journavx, which blocks pain signals sent to the brain at their origin. This drug could be a blockbuster, and it's been on my radar for a while now. Vertex shares climbed about 3% Friday.  Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Huawei's revenue exceeded 860 billion yuan ($118.27 billion) in 2024, Chairman Howard Liang said Wednesday, according to local state media. Huawei did not comment when contacted by CNBC. That's a 22% jump in revenue from 2023, and the fastest growth since a 32% increase in 2016, according to CNBC calculations of publicly released figures. Huawei typically publishes its annual reports in March. Liang, speaking at a local government conference, described Huawei's consumer business as \"returning to growth\" and car solutions business as seeing \"rapid development,\" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese-language report. He said Huawei's information and communications technology business \u2014 which has been the largest segment by revenue \u2014 \"remained stable.\" Since 2019, the U.S. has restricted Huawei's ability to access technology from American suppliers, from advanced 5G chips to Google's Android operating system. Huawei's revenue barely grew in 2020, and plunged by nearly 29% in 2021. Its consumer segment was hit hard, and even as revenue rose 17% year on year to 251.5 billion yuan in 2023, it was just over half of what the unit generated at its peak in 2020. Huawei's smartphone shipments in mainland China surged by 37% last year, climbing from fourth to second place by market share, while Apple fell to third place with a 17% drop, according to Canalys data. Vivo, known for its budget-priced devices, ranked first by market share in 2024, the data showed. The telecommunications company started to make a comeback in the smartphone market\u00a0in 2023\u00a0with the release of its Mate 60 Pro in China. Reviews indicated the device offers download speeds associated with 5G \u2014 thanks to an advanced semiconductor chip. Just over a year later, Huawei launched the Mate 70 smartphone series that uses the company's first fully self-developed operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT. Got a confidential news tip?

Britain's Home Office, which handles immigration and security, last month issued an order to Apple requiring a technical \"backdoor\" that would allow officials to view fully encrypted material uploaded to the cloud software, the Post reported, citing people familiar with the matter. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a Home Office spokesperson. Apple did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The iPhone maker gives users the ability to store all their photos, messages, documents and more on its encrypted iCloud service \u2014 Apple's iCloud is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the owner of the material can view it. Governments in the U.S., U.K. and EU have long expressed dissatisfaction with this setup, arguing it enables criminals, terrorists and sex offenders to conceal illicit activity. In the U.K., the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 empowers the government to compel tech companies to weaken their encryption technologies through so-called \"backdoors.\" Tech firms \u2014 including Apple \u2014 have pushed back on attempts to undermine encryption, saying it would weaken user privacy.

The app is called Apple Invites. Users can create events, such as birthdays, graduations and housewarming parties, and manage RSVPs and guest lists through the app. Apple Invites is also available on the web. While users will not need an iPhone to RSVP to events, they will need a paid iCloud+ subscription to send invites. The launch is the latest example of Apple's services strategy, where the company introduces new paid subscriptions that are marketed to its installed base of 2.35 billion active devices. Apple's Services division has become the company's second-largest business behind the iPhone, reporting $25 billion in sales in the December quarter. Services has also become a big source of Apple's profit, with a gross margin of 74%. The growth of Apple's services division is helping Apple's overall margins expand in recent quarters after years of staying flat. Apple's services business also includes its search deal with Google, Apple Pay payments and device warranties. With Invites, Apple is taking on Partiful, a startup founded in 2020 that allows users to make and send event invites. Partiful posted on social media a joke about Apple's app being a copycat. In a statement, Partiful said that its product is platform-agnostic and can be used regardless of what kind of phone the user or invitee has.  \"With a Shared Photo Album, an interactive comment wall, and ways for guests to connect before, during, and after the event, Partiful has built the most social way to make social plans,\" Partiful said in a statement.  An iCloud+ subscription starts at $1 per month for 50GB of storage, and it is included in Apple's other subscription bundles, ranging up to a $38 per month subscription that also includes the company's TV service, Apple Music and access to games, fitness classes and news. Invites also includes Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of artificial intelligence software. Apple Intelligence can generate images for invites and help write the invitation with the company's Writing Tools. Apple Intelligence also has the ability to share a photo album or playlist with an event's guest list. While Apple does not charge individually for many of its iCloud+ services, it now has a host of paid features intended to get users to upgrade from free storage. That subscription service offers a VPN-style relay service for private browsing, custom email domains for iCloud, local security camera storage and the ability to generate burner emails. Apple does not disclose how many iCloud+ subscribers it has. The company last week said that it has one billion subscribers, but that figure includes subscriptions to apps through the App Store in addition to its direct iCloud subscriptions.

The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is looking into policies that include Apple taking a cut of as much as 30% on in-app spending, as well as blocking third-party payment services and app stores, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. China's market regulator has not decided whether to formally open an investigation into Apple, according to the report. Apple and China's Ministry of Commerce was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. The news comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China ramp up under the administration of President Donald Trump, one month into his second term. Apple has maintained that its strict App Store policies are designed to protect users and improve the experience across its products. China this week also opened a probe into Google over alleged antitrust violations, although the market regulator did not supply details over the focus of the investigation. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that the SAMR is also considering a probe into U.S. chipmaker Intel. Apple's App Store has come under scrutiny from regulators globally. It was forced to open up its App Store in Europe, under the sweeping Digital Markets Act in the EU. This means that it now allows non-Apple companies to offer app stores in Europe, and app developers can also use third-party payment systems. If the China probe goes ahead, it would cause further headache for Apple in one of its biggest markets. The Cupertino giant is already facing stiff competition from local players like Huawei that are eating away at its smartphone market share. Apple sales in Greater China declined 11% year-on-year in the December quarter. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

He was 89. His death was sudden and \"he didn't have a long illness,\" his daughter, Christina Kramlich, confirmed to CNBC, adding that the family will provide more details soon. \"We've lost our warm, curious, ever-optimistic family leader,\" she said. Long before venture capitalist was an established profession, Kramlich saw the opportunity, to invest some cash in tech entrepreneurs and profit alongside of them, assuming they were successful. He'd put some of his own money into Apple before joining with Chuck Newhall and Frank Bonsal to start NEA in 1977, a few years after heavy hitters Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins opened their doors in Menlo Park, California. Kramlich hit it big in computer networking, writing an early check to 3Com, which Bob Metcalfe started as a way to commercialize Ethernet technology. The company went public in 1984, and soared to a valuation of over $28 billion during the dot-com bubble of 2000. 3Com's technology was eventually bypassed by products from Cisco and others and the company was purchased by HP in 2010 for $2.7 billion. Elsewhere in the space, Kramlich invested in Grand Junction, started by a 3Com co-founder, and saw that company through to a 1995 sale to Cisco. And then there was data center networking company Force10 Networks, which was acquired by Dell in 2011. \"So we've gone from the very inception of the Ethernet through to its becoming the dominant protocol of the internet for network communications,\" Kramlich said in a 2006 interview with oral historian Mauree Jane Perry. Kramlich also backed companies including, Macromedia, Ascend Communications and\u00a0Juniper Networks. In the fusion power market, Kramlich invested in TAE Technologies, and sat on the board until the day of his death. Kramlich retired from NEA in 2012, around the time the firm raised $2.6 billion for its 14th fund, one of the biggest ever at the time in the industry. But he wasn't done with investing. In 2017, Kramlich started Green Bay Ventures to invest in companies developing technology and products in manufacturing, energy, transportation, logistics, real estate and communications. He launched Green Bay with Anthony Schiller, who started managing Kramlich's family money in 2011, and Casey Tatham, who was running finance for the family office. The firm was named after the Wisconsin town where Kramlich was born in 1935. Kramlich's dad started a food chain there and his mom became an aeronautical engineer. After moving around Wisconsin as a kid, Kramlich went to college at Northwestern and then moved to the Boston area to pursue a Masters in Business Administration from Harvard. Following business school, Kramlich got into the world of investments in Boston, and eventually met early Apple and Intel investor Arthur Rock. He moved to California and helped start Arthur Rock & Co. in 1969. Eight years later, Kramlich splintered off to start NEA, with operations in Baltimore, Maryland and Silicon Valley. Scott Sandell, NEA's executive chairman, joined the firm in 1996. He said he was working as a consultant and met Kramlich after pitching a startup to the firm, initially in the Baltimore office. His career trajectory quickly changed, and rather than raising money for the startup, he landed a job at NEA and has remained for almost three decades. \"He was the reason so many of us joined,\" Sandell said in an interview. \"Dick was beloved by countless entrepreneurs and venture capitalists because of his undying optimism and perseverance against really all odds. It was that spirit along with his generous and gracious ways that made him more loveable than perhaps any venture capitalist I've ever known.\" Kramlich is survived by his daughter Christina, as well as by his wife, Pam, and his other children, Rix and Mary Donna.

Apple's decline was steeper than all of the tech megacaps, other than Tesla, and shows how vulnerable the iPhone manufacturer could be to increased import costs. While Apple faced tariffs during the first Trump administration, the company was largely able to avoid fees by securing waivers for its specific products. It also expanded its supply chain to do some assembly in countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia and India. But Apple remains reliant on Chinese production. Apple declined to comment on the tariffs. They go into effect on Tuesday. \"Apple being included in China tariffs is contrary to our expectations,\" wrote Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett in a note on Monday. Crockett wrote that he expects Apple to pass price increases to the consumer, a move that he said could upset Trump. \"We thought history would repeat. But that's not the case right now,\" Rosenblatt wrote. Last week, Apple reported 4% revenue growth in the December quarter to $124 billion. However, the company guided investors to expect merely \"low to mid single digits\" growth in the current quarter, and said sales in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong declined 11% in the latest period. The ultimate effect of the tariffs on Apple's profit may depend on how much U.S. demand the company can fill from production locations outside of China. If Apple can source 80% of U.S.-bound devices from outside of China and doesn't raise prices, it could hurt annual earnings by 5 cents per share, or less than 1%, according to a note on Monday from Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan. If half of U.S. Apple devices are from China, it would hurt Apple's full-year earnings by 12 cents, Mohan estimates. For the fiscal year ending in September, analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $7.34, according to LSEG. \"As the new tariff is imposed on imports from China, Apple could have its manufacturing partners ramp up production in India and ship to the U.S.,\" Mohan wrote. \"This could also be done for other Apple products that are manufactured in countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.\" WATCH: Apple 'built for earnings resiliency' Got a confidential news tip?

DNS, short for Domain Name System, converts website names into IP addresses that browsers use to access internet resources. Cloudflare Radar is the connectivity cloud company's hub that displays internet trends and insights with DNS to monitor global internet traffic.\u00a0 TikTok briefly shutdown in the U.S. following the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a law signed by former President Joe Biden in April. That legislation required China-based ByteDance to either divest its ownership of TikTok or have the app face an effective ban in the U.S. on Jan. 19. Consequently, Apple and Google removed TikTok from their U.S. app stores to comply with the law.\u00a0 The app came back online after President Donald Trump said he would postpone enforcement of the ban, signing an executive order on his first day in office to extend the law's deadline by an additional 75 days to April 5. In the meantime, U.S. investors from Frank McCourt to Jimmy Donaldson,\u00a0known as Mr. Beast,\u00a0have offered to do deals\u00a0that would bring ownership of TikTok to the U.S.\u00a0Trump has also expressed interest\u00a0in billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX and owns X,\u00a0or\u00a0Oracle\u00a0Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison\u00a0obtaining partial ownership of the app. The data from Cloudflare shows that, for the most part, TikTok has managed to maintain the bulk of its users and creators in the U.S. despite going offline for about 14 hours and remaining off of the Apple or Google app stores.\u00a0 As for its alternatives, Cloudflare's data shows a spike in traffic the day of the temporary ban, with levels remaining steadily higher in the following week. Traffic for alternatives began to grow a week ahead of the expected shutdown, driven by the increased popularity of RedNote, known as Xiaohongshu in China, Belson said. But traffic to TikTok alternatives peaked on Jan. 19, the day TikTok returned online, he added. \"DNS traffic fell rapidly once the shutdown ended, and has continued to slowly decline over the last week and a half,\" Belson said. With TikTok's long-term future in the U.S. still uncertain, many creators are expanding their online presence to other platforms. \"I've kind of made peace with it going away,\" said Dylan Lemay, a creator with more than 10 million followers on TikTok. \"When they threatened to get rid of it the first time, that was my wake-up call to say I need to make sure that I'm prepared if this ever does happen.\" Trump first threatened to ban TikTok during his first go as president in 2020. Since then, Lemay has been putting efforts into building his followings on other platforms to protect his career as a full-time creator if TikTok is ever officially banned.\u00a0 Lemay said he has found audiences on other platforms. YouTube is where he is now making his most consistent earnings. Currently, he has more than 5.6 million subscribers on YouTube, where he posts long- and short-form videos that have amassed billions of views. \"If the worst comes to worst and TikTok goes away, I have this solid foundation with a company like Google,\" Lemay said. \"That's not going anywhere.\" While some successful TikTok creators have been able to find audiences on YouTube Shorts and Meta's Instagram Reels, many have discovered that their TikTok content doesn't translate as well to other platforms.\u00a0 Noah Glenn Carter, another creator with nearly 10 million TikTok followers, has not been able to find the same kind of audience on Instagram and YouTube, where his following and viewership are significantly lower. In the weeks leading up to the ban, Carter contacted companies he's previously worked with on brand deals, which are agreements where brands pay creators to promote their products and services on social media. With TikTok's future in limbo, brands are pausing or altering their agreements to include competing platforms, Carter and other creators and managers told CNBC. In the meantime, Meta has begun offering creators deals to promote Instagram on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Snapchat and other services, CNBC reported earlier this month. \"I don't know if I can really keep the same rates with my biggest platform going dark,\" said Carter. Other creators say they refuse to believe TikTok will ever truly get banned.\u00a0 \"I'm going to believe it when I see it in those 75 days,\" said Michael DiCostanzo, a creator with more than 2.3 million followers on TikTok. DiCostanzo posts his content to competing short-form video platforms, but he said other apps have yet to build the kind of environment that brought him and others success on TikTok.\u00a0 \"I don't know if YouTube Shorts or Reels can ever actually replicate that sense of community,\" said DiCostanzo. \"If TikTok were to completely shut down, I don't think they would get that big of a boost.\" WATCH: Rep.

Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG: Affirm reported gross merchandise volume, or GMV, of $10.1 billion, topping the average estimate of $9.64 billion, according to StreetAccount, and surpassing $10 billion for the first time. GMV, a key metric that helps gauge the total value of transactions, increased 35% from a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter rose 47% from $591 million a year ago. When revenue grows at a faster rate than GMV, it typically signals strong unit economics. Revenue less transaction costs, or RLTC, jumped 73% to $419 million. The RLTC margin of 4.1% came in ahead of the long-term range of 3% to 4%. Chief Financial Officer Rob O'Hare told CNBC that Affirm's earnings were boosted by a $60 million gain from a deal in December, when the company repurchased some of its convertible debt at a discount. However, he emphasized that business fundamentals were the primary driver. \"We outperformed on adjusted operating income, which is our bottom-line profitability metric that we guide to,\" O'Hare said. For the current quarter, Affirm expects revenue between $755 million and $785 million, or $770 million in the middle of the range, versus the average estimate of $772 million, according to LSEG. The company reiterated its commitment to achieving profitability on a GAAP basis by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter in 2025. Affirm's active consumer base grew 23% year over year to 21 million, while its Affirm Card, which is the company's big bet for driving greater usage overall, now has 1.7 million active users, up more than 136% from the year-ago quarter. Card volume has more than doubled. Affirm's partnerships with Apple, Amazon and Shopify continue to drive momentum. In June, Affirm and Apple announced plans for U.S. Apple Pay users on iPhones and iPads to be able to apply for loans directly through Affirm. The quarter saw a notable rise in 0% interest loans, a strategy in which merchants \u2014 and sometimes manufacturers \u2014 subsidize borrowing costs to drive sales. \"When our merchants turn toward growth, like they frequently do in calendar fourth quarter, they look for ways to do promotions,\" said Max Levchin, Affirm's founder and CEO, during the earnings call. Prior to the earnings report, Affirm shares were up 1.4% for the year after rising 24% in 2024. \u2014 CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report.

It was the worst quarter by growth rate since the December quarter a year ago, and marks the sixth straight quarter of declines in Apple's third-largest region by revenue. Ahead of Apple earnings, analysts had been fretting about exactly this issue. They cited supply chain checks in the country suggesting weak demand and an overall impression that the Chinese consumer was starting to favor locally made devices from companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi over the iPhone. China is \"the most competitive market in the world,\" Cook told analysts on Thursday. In 2024, Apple was third in market share in China, behind Vivo and Huawei, according to an IDC estimate from this week. When Cook was asked about the company's performance in China on Thursday by CNBC's Steve Kovach and analysts on the earnings call, he focused less on the competition and more on how the company's operations decisions affected China sales. Cook said there were a few things to keep in mind about the company's 11.1% decrease in the quarter. Most notably, Cook cited Apple Intelligence's absence in China and Chinese affecting sales. He added that the company's suite of artificial intelligence features for the iPhone 16 had bolstered iPhone sales in the U.S. and other countries where it's available. \"During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,\" Cook said. \u00a0 The company's AI software is only available in English for now, but Apple will release a simplified Chinese version in April, Apple said Thursday. That doesn't necessarily mean Apple Intelligence will launch in China that month, but it does mean Chinese speakers elsewhere will get to test out Apple's AI. \"Until we get through the regulatory process, nothing is certain, and we're going through it now,\" Cook told CNBC. He added that the company is looking for a local partner that is licensed by the country to offer their AI to handle tricky or complicated questions, like OpenAI's ChatGPT does in the U.S. \"There are a number of Chinese companies that do have licenses to operate locally,\" Cook said. \"What we have to do is choose one and work with them on the integration, just like OpenAI.\" About half of the China revenue decline was because the company had misread demand in the country, Cook said. That led to a \"channel inventory\" issue. Apple uses the phrase \"channel\" to describe companies like wireless carriers and retailers that sell Apple devices. \"My point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results,\" Cook said. \"Part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be, toward the end of the quarter.\" Apple ended the quarter \"a little leaner\" in inventory in the country than the company had expected to, said Cook, who also pointed to a nationwide subsidy program that could effectively reduce the cost of some Apple products in the country. \"There is now a national subsidy program that launched on Jan. 20, on categories that some of our products are a part of. It's a fiscal stimulus, kind of,\" Cook told CNBC. The Chinese government introduced subsidy policies last year to boost consumption and domestic demand, according to analyst firm Canalys. Smartphones were added to the list of eligible products earlier this month. The subsidy is capped at 500 yuan per product, and models that cost over 6,000 yuan, such as Apple's Pro phones, aren't eligible. On the earnings call Thursday, Cook said that some of Apple's products including smartphones, tablets, PCs and smartwatches would be covered by the subsidy. \"We do see fiscal stimulus occurring, and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call,\" Cook said.

And promotional discounts can mean new phones sometimes don\u2019t result in higher price tags. In addition, Americans tend to purchase new phones via monthly installment plans through carriers and retailers rather than paying the full retail price up front. A hypothetical price hike of $100, for example, may only translate to an extra few dollars per month \u2013 still an increase, but perhaps a more palatable one.\n     \n            The tariff on Chinese imports, which went into effect Tuesday and sparked a swift retaliation from Beijing, threatens to raise prices across a broad swath of everyday goods, from toys to jewelry and silverware.\n     \n            Yet the technology industry is particularly susceptible given that US tech giants including Apple have key parts of their supply chains in China. And it shows in the numbers: Communications and computer equipment were the top two categories of goods imported to the US from China in 2024, according to US Department of Commerce data.\n     \n            But analysts CNN spoke with don\u2019t predict an immediate impact to smartphone shoppers, in part because price changes likely won\u2019t be reflected in consumer prices until later this year.\n     \n            \u201cIt depends on how long the tariffs last and how pervasive they are,\u201d said Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cI mean, right now we believe no price hike. I think it\u2019s pretty contained.\u201d\n     \n            US consumers tend to purchase new devices through monthly installments, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a research firm that tracks smartphone buying habits.\n     \n            Specifically, 55% of phone buyers in the US \u2013 including those who purchase flip phones and basic mobile phones \u2013 purchase their device through an installment plan, the firm\u2019s data indicated. Another market research firm, the International Data Corporation (IDC), also found that the majority of postpaid smartphones sold in the US are financed by carriers.\n     \n            These payment plans typically allow consumers to pay off the cost of their device over a period of 24 or 36 months, with longer increments typically resulting in lower monthly costs.\n     \n            When a high-profile phone launches, such as the iPhone 16, carriers usually offer additional promotions that allow shoppers to essentially upgrade for free as long as they trade in an old device.\n     \n            However, such deals often come with caveats in the fine print, such as requiring that customers add a new line of service or sign up for a specific (and often expensive) plan.\n     \n            \u201cThe mobile carriers are aggressively pushing the next phone on customers because they use it as a way to tie them to that carrier for a longer period of time,\u201d said Josh Lowitz, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.\n     \n            Should carriers offer similar deals on upcoming phones, consumers may be able to sidestep price hikes entirely by swapping out their old device and signing up for the right data plan.\n     \n            That\u2019s if tariffs impact phone prices at all.\n     \n            And if they do, consumers likely won\u2019t see those price hikes until the fall or holiday season, when the latest batch of iPhones typically launches, says Ives. But tech companies typically decide on prices long before new smartphones land on store shelves, and pricing decisions come down to many factors beyond tariffs, including competition and component costs.\n     \n            \u201cThese are cycles that are very complex, and a lot of the costs are already pre-arranged a year, (or) two  years in advance,\u201d Ives said.\n     \n            Not everyone buying a new phone is splurging on the latest model. Global shipments of officially refurbished and used smartphones grew by 6.4% in 2023 compared to 2022, according to numbers the IDC published in September.\n \n            That same report also suggested the secondary smartphone market has been growing more quickly than the market for new devices. In the US, 60% of consumers either purchased a used smartphone or are open to buying one, according to a separate IDC survey.\n     \n            \u201cBecause of all these trade-ins, the inventory of used devices (is) much better,\u201d said Nabila Popal, a senior director with the IDC\u2019s data and analytics team.\n     \n            That means those shopping for a used phone may have more options to choose from rather than being limited to devices that are several years old.\n     \n            Apple, Google and Samsung typically release new phones in the summer and fall time frames to get ahead of the holiday season, which is likely when the impact of Trump\u2019s tariff on phone prices will start to become clearer. But smartphone shoppers probably won\u2019t have to worry anytime soon.\n     \n            \u201cI think the bark (is) worse than the bite when it comes to overall tariffs in China,\u201d said Ives.\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

On Friday, Target became the latest big company to reverse its DEI programs.\n     \n            The shift in the industry, DEI consultants and analysts say, has left many professionals concerned about their job stability and the future of their careers in the field.\n     \n            \u201cThere is fear and the fear is real,\u201d Fantauzzi said. \u201cI think some of the fear is a lack of understanding. What are the repercussions?\u201d\n     \n            Still, Fantauzzi said he remains optimistic that when the dust settles, companies will reinvent DEI in a way that makes sense from a legal and financial standpoint.\n     \nRelated article\nWhat is DEI, and why is it dividing America?\n \n            Several major companies contacted by CNN did not respond to requests for information about the status of their DEI programs. Other companies and DEI executives declined to comment.\n     \n            Shaun Harper, founder of the Race & Equity Center at the University of Southern California, said he\u2019s spoken with DEI professionals who are anxious about the state of the industry and how the changes could impact their teams and the work they value.\n     \n            \u201cThey are afraid of losing their jobs, of losing their livelihoods, of not being able to get another job,\u201d Harper said. \u201cRight now the jobs that those folks have been doing for years are not en vogue.\u201d\n     \n            There is also a sense of anger in the industry because DEI work is largely misunderstood by critics, Harper said.\n     \n            Experts say DEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings.\n     \n            \u201cThey (DEI professionals) are so incredibly frustrated that they are being lied on and misrepresented as too woke, divisive people who hate America,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not who those folks are.\u201d\n     \n            The reversal of DEI programs could undo the progress made over the past decade to make workplaces more inclusive and supportive of employees from underserved groups, some experts say.\n     \nNaomi Wheeless, chief customer officer at Nextech and an advocate for diversity, said DEI initiatives have helped elevate women, people of color and LGBTQ+ people to leadership roles at companies.\n     \n            Now, Wheeless worries some companies may be reluctant to hire too many non-White people because of how it might be perceived.\n     \nRelated article\nTarget is the latest company to roll back some DEI programs\n \n            \u201cSubconsciously, hiring decisions could start to sway, promotional decisions could start to sway in such a way that it becomes harder for these groups to get ahead,\u201d Wheeless said.\n     \n            \u201cWe have suffered in silence for so long, then we worked very hard to try to level the playing field,\u201d she added. \u201cWe begin to see the fruits of that labor and now the rug is being snatched from under our feet.\u201d\n     \n            Fantauzzi said he expects some people from underrepresented communities to leave the federal government or corporations that drop DEI because they don\u2019t feel valued.\n     \n            The result is a loss of talent that, in some cases, might be hard to replace, he said.\n     \n            Harper said the dismantling of DEI offices may lead to more harassment and discrimination lawsuits against companies because the policies and people that hold employees accountable won\u2019t be there. In many cases, DEI offices are charged with training workers on preventing unconscious bias, discrimination, inequities and sexual harassment.\n     \n            \u201cExisting inequities are going to widen, they are going to worsen as a result of this,\u201d Harper said. \u201cWomen are going to be disadvantaged.\u201d\n     \n            But despite concern among DEI professionals, some remain optimistic there is still a future for DEI.\n     \n            Companies such as Costco, Apple, E.l.f. Beauty and JPMorgan have publicly reaffirmed their commitments to DEI in recent weeks.\n     \nRelated article\nCompanies are running away from DEI. One of America\u2019s biggest beauty brands is standing firm\n \n            A spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz USA said in an email to CNN the company remains \u201ccommitted to fostering an inclusive and equitable environment.\u201d\n     \n            The NFL is also still committed to DEI, Commissioner Roger Goodell said during a news conference last month.\n     \n            Goodell said the league\u2019s rules and policies are \u201cdesigned around how do we increase the number of people that have an opportunity to have a career in the NFL, including people of color and women.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cWe didn\u2019t get into this because it was a trend and we\u2019re not getting out of it because it\u2019s a trend,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe\u2019re in it because it makes the NFL better.\u201d\n     \n            David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at New York University School of Law, said he believes there will continue to be a mixture of companies withdrawing from DEI and those continuing their programs.\n     \n            Glasgow said he encourages professionals to stay committed to the cause because DEI itself is not going away.\n     \n            \u201cNo matter what happens to the field of DEI as it is presently constituted and branded, the underlying work will endure,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cWhat we are all trying to work on together is how do we live together in a multiracial democracy and create institutions of opportunity and fairness where people show up to work each day and feel that they have a fair shot at being hired or promoted. There are too many people in this country that care about these issues for that project to go away.\u201d\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

About 35% reported being deceived by fake content online. However, a larger 41% reported they had encountered content that was real yet misleading and 22% said they had shared information that turned out to be fake. \n \n            The findings come as a growing number of teenagers adopt artificial intelligence. A September Common Sense study showed that seven in 10 teenagers had at least tried generative AI.\n     \n            Two years after ChatGPT\u2019s launch, the AI arena has grown increasingly crowded, with DeepSeek\u2019s meteoric arrival on Monday. But the top models are still prone to AI hallucinations, according to a July 2024 study from Cornell, the University of Washington and the University of Waterloo \u2014 meaning even the top AI platforms still create false information out of thin air.\n     \n            And teenagers who encountered fake online content were more likely to say AI would exacerbate their verification of online information, according to Wednesday\u2019s study from Common Sense, a media and tech nonprofit.\n \n            The survey also pressed teenagers about their thoughts on major tech corporations, including Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok and Microsoft. Nearly half of teenagers don\u2019t trust Big Tech to make responsible decisions about how they use AI, according to the study.\n     \n            \u201cThe ease and speed at which generative AI allows everyday users to spread unreliable claims and inauthentic media may exacerbate teens\u2019 existing low levels of trust in institutions like the media and government,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s study said.\n     \n            Teenagers\u2019 distrust of Big Tech echo a growing dissatisfaction with major tech companies in the United States. American adults also have to contend with increases in misleading or altogether fake content, exacerbated by the erosion of already limited digital guardrails.\n     \n            Since acquiring Twitter in 2022 and renaming the platform X, Elon Musk has gutted its moderation teams, allowed misinformation and hate speech to spread and reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, among other moves. Recently, Meta moved to replace third-party fact-checkers with Community Notes, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted will lead to more harmful content appearing across Facebook, Instagram and its other platforms.\n     \n            \u201cTeens\u2019 perceptions of the accuracy of online content signal a distrust in digital platforms, pointing to an opportunity for educational interventions on misinformation for teens,\u201d the study found, adding that there\u2019s also a \u201cneed for tech companies to prioritize transparency and develop features that enhance the credibility of the content shared on their platforms.\u201d\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "Summary": "Kendrick Lamar has been riding high lately, and now he is poised to reach one of his highest heights yet.\n     \n            Fresh off of winning five Grammy Awards, including song and record of the year for his hit \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lamar is the featured performer for the Super Bowl LIX halftime show on Sunday.\n     \n            Lamar sat for a rare interview during the Apple Music Super Bowl press conference on Thursday, where he was asked what people could expect in his set.\n     \n            \u201cStorytelling,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very open about storytelling through all my catalogue and my history of music. And I\u2019ve always had a passion about bringing that on whatever stage I\u2019m on.\u201d\n     \n            There has been palpable excitement among fans of the rapper, but also interest in how he will handle \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d given both its content and a current lawsuit surrounding the hit.\n     \n            The song is part of a viral-rap battle that occurred between Lamar and Drake last year that has led to a complicated legal case. Leah Stevenson, an entertainment attorney with MGL Law firm, said what began as a beef between two of the biggest stars in hip hop, mushroomed far beyond that.\n     \n            \u201cThis song became a much larger conversation for America about standing on morals, standing on values, standing on the beliefs that we have and the way that we move,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt became a song that people started using in very big cultural moments, so this song has gotten way bigger than just a diss battle.\u201d\n     \n            For that reason and more, all eyes will be on Lamar when he takes the stage before millions at the Super Bowl.\n     \n            Last month, Drake filed a lawsuit against his own record label, UMG Recordings, Inc., in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n     \n            The Canadian rapper and actor has accused the label of defamation in the publishing and promotion of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\n     \n            Drake is currently represented by Republic Records, a division of UMG, while Lamar is currently represented by Interscope records, also a division of UMG. Lamar is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n     \n            \u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist\u2014let alone Drake\u2014is illogical,\u201d a spokesperson for UMG said in a statement to CNN at the time the lawsuit was filed. \u201cWe have not and do not engage in defamation\u2014against any individual. At the same time, we will vigorously defend this litigation to protect our people and our reputation, as well as any artist who might directly or indirectly become a frivolous litigation target for having done nothing more that write a song.\u201d\n     \n            Part of what Drake objects to - and strongly denies - are Lamar\u2019s lyrics in which he raps, \u201cSay Drake, I hear you like \u2018em young/You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d as well as Lamar saying \u201cCertified lover boy? Certified pedophiles\u201d and another portion in the song where he says \u201cTryna strike a cord and it\u2019s probably A Minor.\u201d\n     \nRelated article\nKendrick Lamar keeps winning. Here\u2019s a refresher on how his beef with Drake has fueled his big year\n \n            So might his performing it at the Super Bowl lead to more legal action by Drake, given that he has already come after UMG for defamation?\n     \n            Not necessarily, said Stevenson, who noted that Lamar has several options for how he could handle it during the halftime show.\n     \n            \u201cWould there be a potential requirement where he\u2019s not allowed to perform certain aspects, kind of like a radio edit, where we\u2019re seeing the \u2018A Minor\u2019 and the other language that\u2019s in \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 as problematic and therefore stripped and cut out from him being able to audibly perform that? That is quite possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be a situation where we see Kendrick not being able to say those words, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the entire crowd at the Super Bowl, as well as the millions of Americans that are at home at their their Super Bowl parties would not be singing those words.\u201d\n     \n            CNN has reached out to the NFL to determine if any limitations have been put on Lamar regarding performing the song.\n     \n            Stevenson\u2019s point about the popularity of the song was echoed by Craig Arthur, associate professor of practice in the Academy of Transdisciplinary Studies at Virginia Tech, one of the co-founders of VTDITC: Hip Hop Studies at Virginia Tech.\n \n            \u201cHe\u2019s arguably the most relevant current rapper out right now. A lot of hip hop has been flattened as far as regional sounds, and I feel like Kendrick has really held on to his LA roots,\u201d Arthur said in a statement. \u201cIn a world where a lot of people try to sound like somebody else or try to emulate other folks, he has a unique sound and a unique voice. I think that he\u2019s allowed, because of his position, to explore concepts and topics that a lot of other artists shy away from.\u201d\n     \n            This year\u2019s Super Bowl game is being played in New Orleans and \u201cNot Like Us\u201d has been a large part of the run up to Sunday. From being been played during opening night event on Monday, at the media center, and as part of the NFL\u2019s Super Bowl Experience, there has been no escaping what is now arguably the most famous diss track to ever hit the charts.\n     \n            Lamar, who is known as KDot by his fans, is about to perform to his biggest audience on a stage with a history of controversy. From Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d in 2004 to M.I.A. flipping the bird in 2012 and Beyonc\u00e9 evoking the Black Panthers in 2016, there have been plenty of viral halftime show moments.\n     \n            But for Lamar, \u201cNot Like Us\u201d is more than just a well-placed jab at a fellow artist.\n     \n            \u201c\u2019Not Like Us\u2019 is the energy of who I am, the type of man I represent,\u201d Lamar told collaborator and friend SZA in a conversation for Harper\u2019s Bazaar in October. \u201cNow, if you identify with the man that I represent \u2026 This man has morals, he has values, he believes in something, he stands on something. He\u2019s not pandering.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cHe\u2019s a man who can recognize his mistakes and not be afraid to share the mistakes and can dig deep down into fear-based ideologies or experiences to be able to express them without feeling like he\u2019s less of a man,\u201d the Compton, California native added. \u201cIf I\u2019m thinking of \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 I\u2019m thinking of me and whoever identifies with that.\u201d\n     \n            SZA is scheduled to be a guest at Lamar\u2019s halftime show.\n     \n            Lamar was asked during Thursday\u2019s press conference about his feelings after his major Grammy wins last weekend.\n     \n            \u201cI was just thinking about the culture, really,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when people talk about rap, man, the conversations I hear, they think it is just rap and it\u2019s not an actual art form. So when you put records like that at the forefront, it reminds people that this is more than just something that came 50 years ago.\u201d\n     \nCNN\u2019s Kyle Feldscher contributed to this story\n \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

But, she says, it is better than the alternative: \u201cIf I go back to Honduras, they will kill me.\u201d\n     \n            Week three of the new Trump term is week three of G\u2019s insomnia. Her lawyers tell her she should be OK \u2013 that the asylum process she started a year ago should protect her. But G follows the news closely, hears rumors of ICE sightings constantly and recoils at President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric about people like her.\n     \n            \u201cClaro, si por supuesto,\u201d she answers when asked if she is worried about being deported by Trump despite having a pending asylum case.\n     \n            \u201cOf course, for sure,\u201d is the English translation. \u201cBecause he tries to implement quite strict policies with immigrants in general, and I think even more with people who have just entered the country. At least with the program I entered with, there is some instability, so to speak. So, of course, that increases anxiety and concern.\u201d\n     \n            G entered the United States a year ago, using a Customs and Border Patrol phone app \u2013 CBP One \u2013 designed to streamline and more effectively manage asylum claims. Trump eliminated the app on his first day in office, and his immigration advisers often criticize Biden policies and talk of identifying and deporting migrants who most recently entered the United States.\n     \n            G was a journalist in Honduras, and her reports about political corruption and government collusion with violent gangs made her, she says, a target of regime harassment and violence.\n     \n            \u201cI cannot return under any circumstances because I would be risking my life and my family\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Trump in power, everything I have achieved so far is at risk. He will probably review my case and force me to return \u2013 something I cannot allow. That is my biggest concern.\u201d\n     \n            G shared her story \u2013 and her fears \u2013 only after we agreed to protect her identity. She lives in Nebraska now, a red state that backed Trump by more than 20 points, where we found an immigrant community filled with outrage and fear. Those immigrants and their advocates are convinced the Trump enforcement crackdown is coming to their community sooner or later.\n     \n            \u201cThe fear is real among us,\u201d said G.\n     \n            Our Nebraska visit is part of our evolving \u201cAll Over the Map\u201d project, started in August 2023 to track the 2024 presidential election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key areas or are part of critical voting blocs. Now, with Trump back in the White House, we will keep in touch with those voters as well as adding to the group \u2013 and our target states \u2013 to track key policy initiatives of the new administration.\n     \n            Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen praises the Trump crackdown and has offered state resources to help federal authorities. The governor declined an interview request during our Nebraska visit, but provided CNN a statement that said, in part: \u201cCriminal aliens, weapons, deadly drugs and human trafficking have infiltrated Nebraska communities. I stand with President Trump and have issued my own executive order to ensure Nebraska state agencies do the same.\u201d\n     \n            Police chiefs in the two largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln, have called immigration enforcement a federal issue and said their resources would not be used to assist any federal crackdown. Likewise, public school officials in those cities have said their priority is making students feel welcome, regardless of their status.\n     \n            Mary Choate, an immigration attorney in Lincoln, said the fear and uncertainty have parents worried about sending their children to school, or about attending services offered to them like English lessons.\n     \n            \u201cWe really want to keep immigrants and refugees involved in the community because they\u2019re so integral to our community,\u201d said Choate, executive director of the Center for Legal Immigration Assistance. \u201cBut it\u2019s been very difficult for them to be able to do that because they fear going outside of their homes.\u201d\n     \n            There is no consensus figure on how many undocumented immigrants live in Nebraska. Estimates range from 30,000 to 75,000. Still tiny compared to, say, California, Texas, New York or Illinois.\n     \n            But Nebraska\u2019s total population is just over 2 million and many of its leading industries are desperate for workers. Nebraska is second only to Texas in US beef production, sixth in pork, and its Cornhusker State nickname speaks to its status as an agricultural giant.\n     \n            \u201cTrying to find good, motivated, reliable help is a challenge,\u201d said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. \u201cSo, depending on how the president goes about this, it could be a potentially very, very negative impact.\u201d\n     \n            Even more so, perhaps, as Trump threatens to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which have been delayed for a month. Hansen said any disruption in the US food supply chain caused by an immigration crackdown could be painful for business and consumers.\n     \n            \u201cIf we have a hitch in the get-along in Nebraska, it\u2019s a big enough processing state that\u2019s going to, it\u2019s going to be felt in the food chain,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not unique from other states.\u201d\n     \n            Hansen, a Democrat, has been president of the farmers union since 1989. He is well aware immigration policy has long been political quicksand.\n     \n            \u201cDo we need better enforcement? I think we do,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cBut we, you know, there\u2019s, there\u2019s a constructive way to do it, and there\u2019s a less constructive way to do it.\u201d\n     \n            By that, Hansen means he believes true reform would include both improved border security and a path to status for undocumented immigrants who have not committed any crimes since crossing illegally into the United States.\n     \n            There were proposals to that effect during the George W. Bush administration, and again during the Barack Obama administration.\n     \n            Back then, the ideas under consideration included allowing the undocumented to remain in the states and get on a path to status and even citizenship. Several ways to include accountability were discussed, like paying additional taxes or some other penalty, or perhaps being placed in a longer line for citizenship.\n     \n            But immigration is one of the issues on which Trump\u2019s remake of the GOP is most dramatic. Demanding the undocumented return home is now the overwhelming sentiment in the Republican Party and there is little GOP talk at the moment about broader new immigration legislation.\n     \n            \u201cTrump is primarily a disrupter,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a fixer.  \u2026 Hyper partisanship is not helpful, not constructive. It doesn\u2019t solve problems.\u201d\n     \n            The Trump effect is hardly confined to Washington.\n     \n            \u201cif you\u2019re here illegally, please leave,\u201d is the view of Republican state Sen. Kathleen Kauth. \u201cGo back, go through the process legally.\u201d\n     \n            Kauth is sponsoring legislation to require Nebraska employers to verify their workers have legal status. She sees the proposal as common sense. But she acknowledges the emotions of the national immigration debate might complicate efforts to attract local Democratic support.\n     \n            \u201cI think anytime you have polarization, you know, people tend to go to their sides and stick to it,\u201d Kauth said in an interview at the Nebraska State Capitol. \u201cI\u2019m really more worried about Nebraska and focusing on, what do we need in Nebraska to understand the problem? How do we make sure that we are keeping people who are not here legally from taking jobs from people who are.\u201d\n     \n            Kauth acknowledges Nebraska needs more workers. But she believes the state could handle any disruption caused by stricter immigration enforcement. On the day of our visit, Kauth was also meeting with the leader of a program that helps people recently released from prison find work.\n     \n            \u201cI\u2019m very big into second-chance employment,\u201d Kauth said.\n     \n            In any case, her view is that following the law is paramount.\n     \n            \u201cI kind of view it as a poison fruit, from poison apple, from the poison tree, whatever the legal definition is,\u201d Kauth said. \u201cIf your first act is to break the law, you have become a criminal. And so therefore, everything after \u2013 even if it\u2019s well intentioned, even if it\u2019s wonderful \u2013 please go back and go through the process, because we do want you here, but we need you to do it the right way. And I don\u2019t think that that should ever change.\u201d\n     \n            That sentiment \u2013 in Washington and in Lincoln \u2013 has the immigrant community on edge.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s a scary time for my community,\u201d said a man we agreed to identify only by his nickname, Gin.\n     \n            He was brought into the United States illegally as a child but has a green card now and is working toward citizenship. \u201cThis is what the American Dream is all about, not fear,\u201d Gin said.\n     \n            But Gin said he has family and friends who are undocumented and was worried that speaking to a reporter might make them Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targets.\n     \n            \u201cWhere it going to end?\u201d Gin asked, describing how just a rumor about ICE activity can set off a flurry of nervous phone calls and texts. \u201cIt starts off like, have you seen immigration, have you seen this? And you see the fear in people\u2019s eyes, just the fact that they can\u2019t go out to the store, they can\u2019t go pick groceries, or even hospitals.\u201d\n     \n            Gin wishes Trump would pair tougher border security with some form of amnesty modeled after the approach President Ronald Reagan took four decades ago.\n     \n            But he knows that is beyond wishful thinking.\n     \n            \u201cHis first term was more of, like, let\u2019s see if this can happen,\u201d Gin said. \u201cThis year is more \u2013 I\u2019m going to do it. \u2026 definitely more aggressive.\u201d\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

But this week, she's been posting a steady trickle of content from New Orleans. That's because Austin, 31, from California, is one of hundreds of creators who have swarmed the Big Easy for Super Bowl 59, getting paid large contracts to make social media content for big-name brands like Electronic Arts and Nike. Austin was sent to New Orleans this week by Snap and the NFL to give her fans a behind-the-scenes look at the Super Bowl. She's also involved in integrations around the games with brands like Microsoft and Verizon, for whom she is hosting a promotional fan event. \"I can reach a lot of people myself,\" said Austin, who has about 2 million followers across all platforms. \"So sending a creator like me to an experience, I am engaging my followers to get that awareness.\" As the 2024 NFL season concludes, viewership and engagement among Generation Z and Generation Alpha has hit a record high, according to the NFL. Austin's role underscores a new reality where online creators are treated just like traditional celebrities, in an attempt to attract younger audiences to football. The NFL has made this push in partnership with social apps like YouTube and Snapchat, highlighting the league's evolving marketing strategies that are increasingly focused on digitally native audiences. \"You start to look at these different cohorts of fans, especially the ones that are a little more difficult to reach through linear and you start to see the role in which creators can play and broaden that audience,\" said Ian Trombetta, NFL senior vice president of social, influencer and creator marketing.\u00a0 For this year's Super Bowl, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, brands like Nike and EA are sponsoring creators to attend the event and post content. Austin didn't say how much she's getting paid for the content she's making at Super Bowl 59, but some brands have signed deals of up to six figures with some creators to promote the event, said Victoria Bachan, global president of Sixteenth, a creator talent management company. \"You can no longer really have a media strategy for tentpole opportunities like this that do not include a creator level,\" said Bachan. Brands are increasing their spending on influencer activations for this year's Super Bowl between 25% and 35%, and they're diverting funds from traditional TV-only advertising to do so, according to a study by Captiv8, an influencer marketing platform. The push for creators comes after concerns about younger audiences' lack of interest in sports had grown. A 2022 Emory Goizueta Business School study found that 27% of Gen Z identify as \"anti-sports,\" compared\u00a0with 7% of millennials and 5% of Generation X. The NFL's push to engage creators, which began in 2019, has already paid off. The percentage of Gen Z and Gen A who identify as fans has grown steadily for the last three years to an all-time high as the league's investment in creators has grown, according to the NFL. Besides Austin, Snapchat sent a handful of other creators to the Super Bowl to post behind-the-scenes content using augmented reality filters. Meanwhile, YouTube, which secured a $2 billion-per-year deal for the rights to \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" in 2022, has established itself as pivotal to connecting the league with digital audiences. This year, YouTube will debut as the first official sponsor of the Super Bowl Tailgate, which will\u00a0feature events with top creators like Kristy and Desmond Scott and a livestreamed performance by rapper Post Malone before the game on Sunday. To adapt to these changes, the NFL has eased up on restrictions around the use of official league footage by creators on their YouTube channels.\u00a0 The league and YouTube in January expanded their \"Access Pass\" program to allow retired NFL players like Cam Newton, Jason Kelce and Kurt Benkert to use league footage in their videos.\u00a0 \"There's this pathway now that certainly did not exist five to 10 years ago,\" Trombetta said. \"It's really cool especially as these athletes showcase more of their personalities off the field.\" WATCH: Meta the 'most consequential' company in the world: Futurum CEO Got a confidential news tip?

The software giant topped Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter estimates, posting earnings of $3.23 per share on $69.63 billion in revenue. That surpassed the earnings per share of $3.11 and $68.78 billion in revenue forecast by analysts polled by LSEG. Shares registered their worst day since October 2022. The decline came as Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said the company expects revenues for the current quarter to range between $67.7 billion and $68.7 billion, falling short of the $69.78 billion, per LSEG. Revenue grew 12.3% year over year, the slowest growth since the middle of 2023. Microsoft also posted a slowdown in growth in its Azure and other cloud services revenues. The segment was up 31%, down from 33% in the prior quarter. Many Wall Street analysts stood by the technology behemoth despite the disappointing guide and Azure slowdown. Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan called the company \"well-positioned\" to continue benefiting from artificial intelligence adoption and among the \"most compelling investment opportunities\" in the industry. \"Microsoft has proven they can drive a Cloud business, and now they have shown they can drive the largest AI business via a combination of high-quality Gen AI inferencing and Gen AI apps,\" wrote Bernstein's Mark Moerdler, adding that management needs to pivot toward the core Azure business independent of AI. Microsoft shares dipped 2% during Monday's session as part of a broader tech sector sell-off. The drop came as Wall Street assessed the fallout from DeepSeek's AI models. Estimates suggest the China startup trained its open-source model at a fraction of the costs for other competing U.S. products. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the earnings call that DeepSeek's R1 model is currently available through GitHub and the company's Azure AI Foundry. It will also eventually be accessible on Copilot+ PCs, he said. Other technology stocks saw strong gains during Thursday's trading session on the back of earnings. Meta Platforms jumped nearly 4% on strong results, while Tesla edged up despite missing estimates and reporting a decline in automotive revenue. IBM popped 14% on robust results and notable gains in its software business as AI demand grows. Microsoft is down 1.5% since the start of 2025. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Now Hoffman is diving into the health care, which he describes as \"wondrous and terrifying,\" with his latest startup, Manas AI.\u00a0 Hoffman and Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, an oncologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, unveiled the company on Monday. Manas will use artificial intelligence to try and accelerate the drug discovery process, starting with new treatments for aggressive cancers like prostate cancer, lymphoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\u00a0 Developing new drugs is traditionally a costly and complex process. It can take more than 10 years and cost billions of dollars to develop a single medication, according to a report from Deloitte. Manas said it will use its proprietary chemical libraries and AI-powered filters to identify drug candidates more quickly, ideally reducing the decades-long discovery process to just a few years. \"Most people have had friends, family members, etc., who've died from cancer or had serious cancer problems,\" Hoffman told CNBC in an interview this week. \"If we can make a huge difference on this, and this is the kind of thing that AI can make a huge difference in, it's the kind of reason why AI can be great for humanity.\" Manas raised $24.6 million in seed funding, led by General Catalyst and Hoffman with participation from Greylock, where he is a partner. Hoffman has been deep in AI in recent years. He was an early investor in OpenAI, when the project was still a nonprofit, and he helped start Inflection AI along with DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. Last year, Suleyman joined Microsoft, where Hoffman is a board member, as CEO of a new unit called Microsoft AI. Several Inflection employees joined him. Manas has also inked a partnership with Microsoft, and will leverage its Azure cloud-computing platform. Hoffman, who sold LinkedIn to Microsoft for $27 billion, said Manas is deploying several additional tools from Microsoft as well, including some that are not generally available to the public yet.\u00a0 Hoffman has been working with Mukherjee to create Manas for about a year, though the process picked up steam in the last couple months. Hoffman said the team felt ready to publicly share its ambitions this week since its baseline, foundational resources are in order.\u00a0 The company has a long road ahead, and the drug discovery market is very competitive. Other startups along with major pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Merck, are also exploring how to leverage AI to accelerate drug research and development. \u00a0 Hoffman said he feels confident in Manas's approach, though he would be \"totally delighted\" to see multiple companies flourish.\u00a0 \"We also bring the thing that a startup usually brings, which is a willingness to go very hard, abandon things quickly that aren't working,\" he said. \"Live like this week matters, and the result of this week matters.\"\u00a0 Following Manas's launch on Monday, five different potential strategic partners have already approached the company, Hoffman said.\u00a0\u00a0 Hoffman said the company is in \"build quickly\" and \"learn and deploy\" mode. One of its early initiatives is called Project Cosmos, which is an effort to map out the fundamental rules of drug binding, according to the company's website. Hoffman declined to share any additional details about the project.\u00a0 Manas currently has just four employees \u2013 including Hoffman and Mukherjee \u2013 but Hoffman said it will grow. He's been acting as the company's \"AI guy\" while Mukherjee serves as the \"bio guy,\" he said. Ultimately, Manas is about melding the two fields.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It isn't just the best of science and it isn't just the best of AI, because either of those two are insufficient,\" Hoffman said. \"You need to put those two together.\" As the AI guy, Hoffman was paying close attention this week to the sudden emergence of China's DeepSeek in the U.S. DeepSeek began generating buzz in January, when the startup released its open-source reasoning model R1, which rivals OpenAI's o1. The model was reportedly developed at a fraction of the cost of rival models by OpenAI, Anthropic,\u00a0Google\u00a0and others. Hoffman said that while DeepSeek might encourage American companies to pick up the pace and share their plans sooner, the new revelations don't suggest that large models are a bad investment. \"The competition game is on,\" he said, \"But I don't think it's the 'Oh my God, we're losing!' as American technology.\" WATCH: LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman on DeepSeek Got a confidential news tip?

The two also announced a new joint venture, billed as \"SB OpenAI Japan,\" which will market OpenAI's enterprise tech exclusively to major companies in Japan. The deal will give SoftBank and its subsidiaries access to ChatGPT Enterprise, OpenAI's API, custom models and agent products such as Operator, which it describes as \"an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you,\" such as planning vacations and filling out forms. It also will include access to OpenAI's newest agent feature, once it launches: a tool called \"Deep Research\" which OpenAI says will be able to conduct multistep analysis on the web. SoftBank branded all the OpenAI products it will use as a suite of tools \"Cristal Intelligence.\" Arm, the British chip designer acquired by SoftBank in 2016, will also use OpenAI tools to \"boost productivity across the company,\" according to the announcement. At a livestreamed event early Monday morning, which was jointly held by SoftBank, SoftBank Group, OpenAI and Arm, executives in the audience represented companies that collectively accounted for more than half of Japan's total market capitalization, according to SoftBank. During the presentation, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said that he believes artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014\u00a0a vaguely defined benchmark referring to AI that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks \u2014\u00a0will be a reality in fewer than 10 years. Son said via a translator that he believes \"AGI can be achieved in large enterprise businesses first,\" adding that to achieve it, \"quite the huge amount of money is necessary\" and that such funds are \"only available in large enterprises at the moment.\"\u00a0 News of SoftBank and OpenAI's strategic partnership comes days after CNBC confirmed that OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $40 billion in a funding round led by Son's SoftBank at a potential valuation of $300 billion, according to a source familiar, who amended the recently reported $340 billion figure. SoftBank would contribute between $15 billion and $25 billion, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be named because the talks are ongoing. If the round were completed, SoftBank would surpass\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0as OpenAI's top backer. Part of the funding may be used for OpenAI's commitment to Stargate, a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and\u00a0Oracle\u00a0that was introduced by\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0last month, the sources said. The plan calls for billions of dollars to be invested in U.S. AI infrastructure. During the presentation Monday morning, Son said he was looking forward to working with OpenAI, Oracle and others on the Stargate project. OpenAI was last valued at $157 billion by private investors. In late 2022, the company launched its ChatGPT chatbot, kicking off a boom in generative AI. OpenAI\u00a0closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with\u00a0Elon Musk's\u00a0xAI, as well as Microsoft,\u00a0Google,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and Anthropic. Meanwhile, Chinese startup lab DeepSeek has gone viral in the U.S, presenting fresh competition to OpenAI. DeepSeek saw its app\u00a0soar\u00a0to the top of\u00a0Apple's\u00a0App Store rankings last week and roiled U.S. markets on reports that its powerful model was trained at a fraction of the cost of U.S. competitors. At an event in Washington, D.C., on Thursday hosted by OpenAI, CEO Sam Altman said DeepSeek is \"clearly a great model.\" \"This is a reminder of the level of competition and the need for democratic Al to win,\" he said. He said it also points to the \"level of interest in reasoning, the level of interest in open source.\" Correction: This article has been updated to correct when Stargate was introduced and when DeepSeek soared to the top of\u00a0Apple's\u00a0App Store rankings.

In December, the company gave access to developers and trusted testers, as well as wrapping some features into Google products, but this is a \"general release,\" according to Google. The suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is billed as a \"workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale,\" as well as 2.0 Pro Experimental for coding performance, and 2.0 Flash-Lite, which the company calls its \"most cost-efficient model yet.\" Gemini Flash costs developers 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash-Lite, its more cost-effective version, costs 0.75 of a cent for the same. Tokens refer to each individual unit of data that the model processes. The continued releases are part of a broader strategy for Google of\u00a0investing heavily into AI agents as the AI arms race heats up among tech giants and startups alike. Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are also moving toward agentic AI, or models that can complete complex multistep tasks on a user's behalf, rather than a user having to walk them through every individual step. \"Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,\" Google wrote in a December blog post, adding that Gemini 2.0 has \"new advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use,\" and that the family of models \"will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\" Anthropic, the\u00a0Amazon-backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, is a key competitor in the race to develop AI agents. In October, Anthropic\u00a0said\u00a0its AI agents were able to use computers like humans to complete complex tasks. Anthropic's computer use capability allows its technology to interpret what's on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said. The tool can \"use computers in basically the same way that we do,\" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time. He said it can do tasks with \"tens or even hundreds of steps.\" OpenAI released a\u00a0similar feature recently called Operator that will automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations and ordering groceries. The\u00a0Microsoft-backed startup described Operator as \"an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.\" Earlier this week, OpenAI introduced Deep Research, which allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports and analyze questions and topics of the user's choice. Google in December launched a similar tool of the same name \u2014\u00a0Deep Research \u2014\u00a0which acts as a \"research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports on your behalf.\" CNBC first reported in December that Google would\u00a0introduce several AI features early in 2025. \"In history, you don't always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a strategy meeting at the time. \"I think that's what 2025 is all about.\" Got a confidential news tip?

The capex figure came in ahead of the $59.73 billion consensus estimate for Google, according to Visible Alpha. On its earnings call, Alphabet said it expects $16 billion to $18 billion of those expenses to come in the first quarter. Overall, the expenditures will go toward \"technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking,\" finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said. Alphabet's announcement came alongside a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report. Shares fell 8% after the company topped Wall Street's earnings estimates by 2 cents per share, but fell short on revenue expectations. Alphabet and its megacap tech rivals are rushing to build out their data centers with next-generation AI infrastructure, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Last month, Meta said it plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year as part of its AI push. Microsoft has committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures in its current fiscal year. The recent rise of China's DeepSeek open-source models has led to some concerns about whether companies need to invest as heavily in their buildouts. Those fears rocked financial markets early last week, spurring a sell-off that contributed to the worst one-day market value loss for a company in history. Many technology CEOs have called attention to the Chinese startup and its implications for U.S.-based tools. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said DeepSeek is showing \"real innovations,\" while Palantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC last week that competing AI models means the U.S. needs an \"all-country effort\" to develop the technology faster. In addition to infrastructure purchases, Alphabet said it expects headcount growth in 2025 \"in key investment areas such as AI and cloud.\" WATCH: Alphabet's AI drug development could be tailwind Got a confidential news tip?

Washington will join Salesforce in March, replacing finance chief Amy Weaver and operating chief Brian Millham, who will retire in May. In August, Salesforce said Weaver would step down once the company had named a successor. Under Weaver, Salesforce widened its adjusted operating margin earlier than planned after activist investors came in to the stock. Shares of Salesforce slipped almost 2% in extended trading. Washington, 62, has been Salesforce's lead independent director since 2022, after taking a seat on its board in 2013. In 2019, she retired from Gilead and became a director at Alphabet. Washington will remain on Salesforce's board, and Arnold Donald, the former Carnival CEO who has been on Salesforce's board since 2023, will become lead independent director, according to a statement. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised Washington's abilities in a post on social media site X. \"A visionary leader, former CFO of Gilead & Hyperion, and longtime Salesforce board member, Robin's expertise will guide us into the Agentforce era,\" Benioff wrote. Salesforce has been busy promoting Agentforce add-on software that can automate sales and customer service processes inside of companies. Earlier in her career, Washington ran finance at enterprise software provider Hyperion and was a vice president at software seller PeopleSoft. She has also been an auditor at Deloitte. Hyperion and PeopleSoft were both acquired by Oracle, where Benioff worked before he co-founded Salesforce in 1999. Millham took a job as president of commercial sales at Salesforce months after the company's establishment. He was promoted to president and operating chief in August 2022. In early 2023, when co-CEO Bret Taylor left in 2023, Millham took on some of Taylor's responsibilities.

Masayoshi Son's SoftBank would lead the round, contributing between $15 billion and 25 billion, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be named because the talks are ongoing. SoftBank would surpass Microsoft as OpenAI's top backer. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the talks. Part of the funding may be used for OpenAI's commitment to Stargate, a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and\u00a0Oracle\u00a0that was introduced by\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0last week, the sources said. The plan calls for billions of dollars to be invested in U.S. AI infrastructure. OpenAI was last valued at $157 billion by private investors. In late 2022, the company launched its ChatGPT chatbot and kicked off the boom in generative AI. OpenAI\u00a0closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with\u00a0Elon Musk's\u00a0xAI, as well as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Anthropic. Meanwhile, Chinese startup lab DeepSeek is blowing up in the U.S, presenting fresh competition to OpenAI. DeepSeek saw its app\u00a0soar\u00a0to the top of\u00a0Apple's\u00a0App Store rankings this week and roiled U.S. markets on reports that its powerful model was trained at a fraction of the cost of U.S. competitors. At an event in Washington, D.C., on Thursday hosted by OpenAI, CEO Sam Altman said DeepSeek is \"clearly a great model.\" \"This is a reminder of the level of competition and the need for democratic Al to win,\" he said. He said it also points to the \"level of interest in reasoning, the level of interest in open source.\" WATCH: OpenAI in talks to raise up to $40 billion in funding round Got a confidential news tip?

Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations: Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 14% from $1.36 billion a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $9.1 million, or a penny a share. In the prior year, Snap recorded a fourth-quarter net loss of $248 million, or 15 cents a share. Snap said it expects first-quarter revenue to come in between $1.325 billion and $1.36 billion. The midpoint of that range is $1.34 billion, higher than Wall Street projections of $1.33 billion. However, Snap's first-quarter adjusted earnings will fall in the range of $40 million to $75 million, below analyst expectations of $78.5 million. In an investor letter, Snap attributed the guidance to \"investment plans for the quarter ahead.\" First-quarter adjusted operating expenses will grow in the range of 11% to 12% year over year due to hiring, legal-related costs, and \"a seasonal shift of marketing expenses into Q1 relative to the prior year,\" Snap said. \"As we look ahead to 2025, we see additional opportunities to invest productively in scaling our business given the foundational improvements we have made to our ad platform and the momentum we have established in our go to market initiatives,\" particularly in the segment focused on small and medium-sized businesses, Snap said in the letter. \"Our investment plans for 2025 reflect this optimism, alongside a strong commitment to make further financial progress towards profitability as we scale.\" Additionally, the company said it committed $5 million to \"support communities and team members\" affected by the recent Los Angeles wildfires and that it anticipates making \"further commitments over time.\" In September, the New Mexico attorney general\u00a0filed\u00a0a lawsuit against Snap that alleged the company's Snapchat app's design and recommendation systems \"openly foster and promote illicit sexual material involving children and facilitate sextortion and the\u00a0trafficking\u00a0of children, drugs, and guns.\" Earlier in January, Snap shares\u00a0dropped\u00a0after the Federal Trade Commission said it would refer a complaint against the company related to its My AI chatbot to the Department of Justice. Last week, Meta reported fourth-quarter results that beat on revenue and earnings and reiterated its plans to spend heavily on AI-related investments. Alphabet on Tuesday beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Pinterest reports earnings Thursday followed by Reddit next week. Snap said daily active users for the first quarter will be 459 million, topping analyst expectations of 458.3 million. The company said its Snapchat+ service now has 14 million subscribers, up from the 12 million it reported during the third quarter. The service, which debuted in 2022, makes up the bulk of what Snap calls \"other revenue.\" That unit grew 131% year over year in 2024 and has an \"annualized revenue run rate of well over $500 million,\" the company said. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a Tuesday call with analysts that he's pleased with the user response to Snapchat+ and the company may consider raising its subscription price, which currently costs $3.99 a month. Spiegel also commented about China-based DeepSeek's breakthrough AI model that was allegedly cheaper and quicker to build and operate compared to other similar software from tech giants like Meta, Alphabet and OpenAI. DeepSeek's AI model shows that \"Capital is not a long-term moat in the technology business,\" Spiegel said. \"It's been really inspiring to see the innovation there,\" Spiegel said. \"I think it validates our view that a lot of these models are going to continue to be commoditized over time, more efficient to run.\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts last week that his company was still digesting some of DeepSeek's capabilities, but added that it's \"probably too early to really have a strong opinion on what this means for the trajectory around infrastructure and CapEx,\" suggesting that Meta won't slash its AI spending anytime soon. Regarding whether Snap has seen any impact from TikTok's potential ban in the U.S., Spiegel said \"The overall environment of uncertainty is benefiting our business.\" He said that both advertisers and creators are looking to \"diversify\" the social platforms they rely on, and Snap is helping them with their planning. Snap said Ajit Mohan will become chief business officer after previously serving as president of the Asia-Pacific region. Before joining Snap in 2023, Mohan was the vice president and managing director of India at Meta. WATCH: Meta and Microsoft defend AI capex spend post-DeepSeek Got a confidential news tip?

The DOE chief information office is the department\u2019s IT and cybersecurity office.\n     \n            Members of the general counsel and chief information offices \u201csaid this is a bad idea\u201d because Farritor hadn\u2019t had a standard background investigation needed to access the department\u2019s system, one of the people told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s not cleared to be in DOE, on our systems. None of those things have been done.\u201d\n     \n            Farritor was granted access to basic IT including email and Microsoft 365, one of the people said. The chief information office only does a small amount of IT and cybersecurity work for the National Nuclear Security Administration, they said, including providing connectivity and running basic internet services for NNSA\u2019s headquarters. It does not run IT systems for the nuclear agency\u2019s labs controlling the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile.\n     \n            On Friday, department leadership installed a different SpaceX engineer, Ryan Riedel, as chief information officer, three people familiar with the matter told CNN \u2014 the department\u2019s top IT official charged with managing tech acquisitions and protecting personnel data across a vast bureaucracy.\n     \n            Riedel spent four years at SpaceX as a network security engineer, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he spent several years in various tech roles at the Army and Navy, according to the profile.\n     \n            An Energy Department spokesperson did not return a request for comment.

About 35% reported being deceived by fake content online. However, a larger 41% reported they had encountered content that was real yet misleading and 22% said they had shared information that turned out to be fake. \n \n            The findings come as a growing number of teenagers adopt artificial intelligence. A September Common Sense study showed that seven in 10 teenagers had at least tried generative AI.\n     \n            Two years after ChatGPT\u2019s launch, the AI arena has grown increasingly crowded, with DeepSeek\u2019s meteoric arrival on Monday. But the top models are still prone to AI hallucinations, according to a July 2024 study from Cornell, the University of Washington and the University of Waterloo \u2014 meaning even the top AI platforms still create false information out of thin air.\n     \n            And teenagers who encountered fake online content were more likely to say AI would exacerbate their verification of online information, according to Wednesday\u2019s study from Common Sense, a media and tech nonprofit.\n \n            The survey also pressed teenagers about their thoughts on major tech corporations, including Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok and Microsoft. Nearly half of teenagers don\u2019t trust Big Tech to make responsible decisions about how they use AI, according to the study.\n     \n            \u201cThe ease and speed at which generative AI allows everyday users to spread unreliable claims and inauthentic media may exacerbate teens\u2019 existing low levels of trust in institutions like the media and government,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s study said.\n     \n            Teenagers\u2019 distrust of Big Tech echo a growing dissatisfaction with major tech companies in the United States. American adults also have to contend with increases in misleading or altogether fake content, exacerbated by the erosion of already limited digital guardrails.\n     \n            Since acquiring Twitter in 2022 and renaming the platform X, Elon Musk has gutted its moderation teams, allowed misinformation and hate speech to spread and reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, among other moves. Recently, Meta moved to replace third-party fact-checkers with Community Notes, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted will lead to more harmful content appearing across Facebook, Instagram and its other platforms.\n     \n            \u201cTeens\u2019 perceptions of the accuracy of online content signal a distrust in digital platforms, pointing to an opportunity for educational interventions on misinformation for teens,\u201d the study found, adding that there\u2019s also a \u201cneed for tech companies to prioritize transparency and develop features that enhance the credibility of the content shared on their platforms.\u201d\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Earnings per share for the Google parent company beat analysts' estimates by two cents. Here are the numbers: Here are other numbers Wall Street was watching: Alphabet's overall revenue grew nearly 12% year over year, compared to more than 13% growth in the same quarter last year. The company's revenue growth, as well as growth for its search business, its YouTube ads business and its services unit were all slower compared to a year ago. Google's advertising revenue growth was 10.6%, compared to 11% a year ago. Search revenue growth was 12.5%, compared to 12.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. YouTube ads revenue growth was 13.8% compared to 15.5% a year ago, and growth for the company's services business was 10.2%, compared to 12.4% a year ago. The company also announced that it plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to expand on its AI strategy. That is above the $58.84 billion that Wall Street expected, according to FactSet. Alphabet said it expects capital expenditures for the first quarter to come in between $16 billion and $18 billion, which was also higher than the $14.3 billion that was expected, per FactSet. Alphabet's capital expenditure for the quarter was $14 billion, which is higher than the $13.26 billion Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount. Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi said on an earnings call with investors that the figure primarily reflects the company's investment in its technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investments in servers, followed by data centers \"to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.\" The company's fourth-quarter net income increased more than 28% to $26.54 billion from $20.69 billion a year prior. Alphabet also reported disappointing cloud revenue at $11.96 billion during the quarter, compared to $12.19 billion, expected by Wall Street. Despite the miss, the cloud unit's revenue increased 30% from the year prior. Alphabet has been drawing profit from the cloud business as it tries to keep up with market leaders\u00a0Amazon Web Services and\u00a0Microsoft Azure. Asked if revenue for the company's cloud unit could have been higher with more compute capacity, Ashkenazi said the company had strong demand for AI products in the fourth quarter, and that it \"exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\" \"We are in a tight supply-demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online,\" Ashkenazi continued, saying the company will be adding more capacity throughout the year. Alphabet's Other Bets segment, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $400 million in the fourth quarter. That came behind Wall Street's expectations of $616.4 million, according to StreetAccount, and it was down more than 39% from $657 million in the same quarter last year. The company made a series of announcements in the fourth quarter related to Waymo, showing confidence in its ability to commercialize its self-driving car company more quickly. Waymo's robotaxi service now operates in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, covering more than 500 square miles of public roads. In December, the company said it plans to launch its commercial service in\u00a0Austin, Texas,\u00a0and through the\u00a0Uber app in Austin and Atlanta\u00a0in 2025. The company also announced that it will begin testing Waymo in Tokyo, its\u00a0first international expansion.

U.S. companies created 183,000 jobs last month, according to the ADP's monthly data. That was slightly more than the upwardly revised 176,000 in December and much more than the 150,000 economists were expecting. Will Friday's government employment report show this kind of strength? 2. Wall Street was looking at a lower open as shares of Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices sank after their earnings reports. Wednesday morning: bond yields dipped, gold hit a record high, and oil slumped 1%. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all higher Tuesday. 3. Alphabet dropped a bombshell that it needs to spend a much higher-than-expected $75 billion for cloud and data center in 2025. Seems like concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek curtailing AI chip demand are more of a side show. Good news for Club names Nvidia and Broadcom, which makes TPUs for Google.

He said it's wise to refrain from sudden moves next week as there won't be enough time to digest such a large amount of information. \"When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands,\" he said. \"Because there's just too much data for any individual to process,\" Palantir is set to report Monday after close, and Cramer pointed out that the data company has been especially favored by the Pentagon as it helps companies and the government use resources more efficiently. He suggested it's likely the stock continues to climb, noting that some investors are fond of CEO Alex Karp. Tuesday is packed with earnings reports. Cramer expects PayPal and Spotify to have great quarters. He noted that Spotify has a successful subscription model that usually helps top Wall Street estimates. Drug giants Merck and Pfizer will also release their numbers. Merck's could be good, he said, and if Pfizer can report positive news about its cancer dugs, that stock could run. PepsiCo and Chipotle also report on Tuesday. According to Cramer, the packaged food stocks have had a tough time since GLP-1 weight loss drugs became popular, especially PepsiCo, known for its soft drinks and snacks. He called the Mexican fast food chain a great growth stock in the restaurant sector and suggested now could be a chance to invest before shares move higher.  Plus, Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices have earnings are on deck Tuesday. Cramer said the Google parent's stock could rise if it reports solid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. He also wondered what AMD will have to say in the wake of breakthrough news from China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, which could make AMD's chips are more desirable. On Wednesday are reports from Walt Disney, Novo Nordisk and Ford. Disney could be a buy before earnings, Cramer said, even as the fires in Los Angeles likely hurt the quarter. He said he'll be waiting to see how Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs are doing, and that Ford stock has been disappointing lately. Thursday brings results from more drug stocks, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb, as well as Amazon. Cramer said he needs more details from Eli Lilly that suggest next year will be successful, and he's optimistic about Bristol Myers's new schizophrenia drug. Cramer added that he's expecting positive earnings from Amazon, but investors might want to wait until after it reports to buy the stock. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the nonfarm payroll report, an inflation metric that's important to the Federal Reserve. If the data suggests strong growth in employment and wages, it may be unlikely the central bank will cut rates in the first half of the year, Cramer said.

The capex figure came in ahead of the $59.73 billion consensus estimate for Google, according to Visible Alpha. On its earnings call, Alphabet said it expects $16 billion to $18 billion of those expenses to come in the first quarter. Overall, the expenditures will go toward \"technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking,\" finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said. Alphabet's announcement came alongside a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report. Shares fell 8% after the company topped Wall Street's earnings estimates by 2 cents per share, but fell short on revenue expectations. Alphabet and its megacap tech rivals are rushing to build out their data centers with next-generation AI infrastructure, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Last month, Meta said it plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year as part of its AI push. Microsoft has committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures in its current fiscal year. The recent rise of China's DeepSeek open-source models has led to some concerns about whether companies need to invest as heavily in their buildouts. Those fears rocked financial markets early last week, spurring a sell-off that contributed to the worst one-day market value loss for a company in history. Many technology CEOs have called attention to the Chinese startup and its implications for U.S.-based tools. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said DeepSeek is showing \"real innovations,\" while Palantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC last week that competing AI models means the U.S. needs an \"all-country effort\" to develop the technology faster. In addition to infrastructure purchases, Alphabet said it expects headcount growth in 2025 \"in key investment areas such as AI and cloud.\" WATCH: Alphabet's AI drug development could be tailwind Got a confidential news tip?

At one point on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped 1.5%. But by the end of the day, the 30-stock index had recovered somewhat after Trump agreed to pause the tariff increase with Mexico for a month and negotiate further with the country. Trump also announced later in the afternoon that he would do the same for Canada The Dow finished down 0.28%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.2%. Cramer said Wall Street needs to realize that Trump intends to follow through on campaign promises, even if they hurt the stock market. The president isn't focused on conventional inflation, interest rates, the Federal Reserve or even the supermarket, he continued. Instead, Trump is convinced his tariff plan is what will \"make America great again,\" and he won't hold back on that agenda, Cramer added, . Cramer also reviewed other sector action on Monday. He pointed out how companies that offer value meals and consumer products rallied, even as some rely on Mexican imports, like Chipotle, Costco and Walmart. Traders were indifferent to this potential issue because the companies do much of their business domestically, he suggested. Tech also rallied, but Cramer indicated that their action for the rest of the week remains uncertain as Wall Street waits to hear earnings from Alphabet and Amazon. Investors should be prepared for more bumpy days ahead, he concluded. \"Get used to the turmoil,\" Cramer said. \"You don't have to enjoy it, but remember that, in the end, the President sure does.\" Click here to download\u00a0Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing\u00a0at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

In Monday's moving target on tariffs, we looked at what these trade levies mean for 10 portfolio stocks. 2. Alphabet kicks off a busy week of earnings from Club names, reporting quarterly results after Tuesday's close.

Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting Amazon to report ad revenue of $17.4 billion. The online retail giant revealed its latest advertising sales results Thursday as part of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company said fourth-quarter sales were $187.79 billion, which was ahead of analysts' estimates of $187.3 billion. But the company's shares fell on disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Amazon's online advertising unit has grown considerably over the years and is the third-biggest platform in the global digital advertising market, trailing Alphabet and Meta, respectively, according to data provided to CNBC by Emarketer. Meta on Jan. 29 reported fourth-quarter sales that rose 21% year over year to $48.39 billion. Alphabet reported its fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday and said its Google advertising sales and YouTube ad revenue came in at $72.46 billion and $10.47 billion, respectively, representing an 11% and 14% increase from the prior year. As part of Microsoft's latest quarterly earnings, revealed Jan. 29, the enterprise tech giant said its search and news advertising sales increased 21% year over year. Microsoft does not disclose that unit's specific quarterly sales figures. Also on Thursday, Pinterest reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.15 billion, representing an 18% increase from the prior year during the same period. Snap on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter sales rose 14% year over year to $1.56 billion.

Major U.S. benchmarks snapped a two-day losing streak in a relief rally. With the temporary respite in U.S. tariffs on\u00a0key countries, investors\u00a0could turn their attention to earnings. But what they saw on Tuesday wasn't likely to comfort them after the turmoil wreaked by tariffs. Alphabet's scorecard for its fourth-quarter performance missed the \"A\" grade so many expect from Big Tech names. Meanwhile, AMD's data center sales, a key part of its business, missed estimates. Investor disappointment was immediate: Shares of both companies slumped in extended trading, signaling that corporate fundamentals remain critical to stock performance. Tech revenue falls short of estimatesAlphabet fourth-quarter results missed revenue expectations, causing shares to fall around 7% in extended trading. CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release that Google expects to invest \"approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.\" Meanwhile, fourth-quarter data center sales of Advanced Micro Devices missed estimates, while net income dropped to $482 million from $667 million a year ago. Shares of AMD slumped nearly 9% in extended trading. Roadblocks for Japanese automakersHonda and Nissan are calling off merger talks, according to a Wednesday report by Asahi Shimbun, citing sources. Honda had proposed making Nissan a subsidiary of the merged entity, an idea opposed by the latter, the report said. Separately, Toyota Motor reported fiscal third-quarter operating profits that dropped 28% from a year earlier and missed LSEG estimates. The results mark Toyota's second consecutive fall in quarterly profit. Markets shake off tariff fearsU.S. stocks climbed on Tuesday as investors' worries were assuaged by Trump's pause of tariffs on Mexico and Canada. The S&P 500 rose 0.72%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.35%. Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose Wednesday. South Korea's Kospi index advanced more than 1%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 ticked up 0.1%, but mainland China's CSI 300 fell around 0.6% after returning from the Lunar New Year break. Palestine, Trump's 'Riviera of the Middle EastThe United States \"will take over the\u00a0Gaza Strip,\" and \"we'll own it,\" Trump said Tuesday at the White House during a joint news conference with Israel's Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu. The former New York real estate developer suggested that Gaza eventually could be \"the Riviera of the Middle East,\" where \"the world's people\" could make their homes \u2014 and the 2 million\u00a0Palestinians\u00a0currently living in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0should leave and be placed in other countries in the Middle East. [PRO] An under-the-radar opportunity in AIArk Invest's Cathie Wood thinks there's an under-the-radar investing opportunity in the artificial intelligence boom, and one of her high-conviction bets is up nearly 10% for the year so far. Wood also told CNBC she's moving away from hardware, and looking at software plays in the artificial intelligence space. The Fed could find itself in a policy Catch-22 if tariffs spike inflation and slow growth When Trump launched tariffs in his first term, inflation was low and the Fed was raising rates as it sought a \"neutral\" level. A\u00a0manufacturing recession ensued\u00a0in 2019. This time around, the targeted tariffs that Trump had previously used have been replaced by the\u00a0threat of blanket duties \u2014 which could slow growth and raise prices, putting the U.S. Federal Reserve in a position where it has to weigh economic expansion against controlling inflation.

The stock registered its worst session since January 2024.  The company topped earnings estimates by 2 cents per share. Revenue came in at $96.47 billion, behind the $96.56 billion expected by LSEG. Alphabet's revenue grew 12% overall from a year ago, while its YouTube advertising business, search business and services segment slowed year over year. Alphabet also said it plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures as it builds out its AI offerings and races against megacap rivals to build out data centers and new infrastructure. The figure was much higher than the $58.84 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to FactSet. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said the higher expenses will help \"support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.\" She also said the spending will go toward \"technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.\" The company expects capital expenditures to range between $16 billion and $18 billion. That was higher than the $14.3 billion estimate from FactSet. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth highlighted costs, capex and cloud revenue as the \"culprits\" for the stock's post-earnings performance. Bernstein's Mark Shmulik also noted that this is the third quarter that the stock move connects to Google's cloud segment. \"If digital ad growth is akin to a long drive competition, then Google would be sitting comfortably here with strong Search and YouTube bombs down the fairway,\" Shmulik said. \"But as the game shifts to the AI putting green, there's little room for error with a slight cloud miss, a whopping CAPEX guide up to $75B for 2025, and lack of actionable operating leverage commentary leaves Google 3- putting for bogey,\" he added.

Major U.S. benchmarks snapped a two-day losing streak in a relief rally. With the temporary respite in U.S. tariffs on\u00a0key countries, investors\u00a0could turn their attention to earnings. But what they saw on Tuesday wasn't likely to comfort them after the turmoil wreaked by tariffs. Alphabet's scorecard for its fourth-quarter performance missed the \"A\" grade so many expect from Big Tech names. Meanwhile, AMD's data center sales, a key part of its business, missed estimates. Investor disappointment was immediate: Shares of both companies slumped in extended trading, signaling that corporate fundamentals remain critical to stock performance. Alphabet falls short of revenue estimateAlphabet fourth-quarter results missed revenue expectations, causing shares to fall as much as 9% in extended trading. The tech giant's revenue came in at $96.47 billion, compared with $96.56 billion expected by LSEG. CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release that Google expects to invest \"approximately $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.\" AMD data center sales disappointAdvanced Micro Devices shares slumped nearly 9% in extended trading after the company reported fourth-quarter data center sales of $3.86 billion, which missed the FactSet estimate of $4.14 billion. Net income came in at $482 million, down from $667 million a year ago. The chipmaker, however, beat Wall Street expectations for overall sales and earnings. UBS share buyback fails to impressUBS on Tuesday reported net profit attributable to shareholders of $770 million, compared with a $483 million estimate in a company-provided consensus estimate and with a mean forecast of $886.4 million in a LSEG poll of analysts. The bank also announced plans to repurchase up to $3 billion of shares in 2025 \u2014 but that didn't impress investors, causing the bank's shares to fall 7%. Markets shake off tariff fearsU.S. stocks climbed on Tuesday as investors' worries were assuaged by U.S. President Donald Trump's pause of tariffs on Mexico and Canada. The S&P 500 rose 0.72%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.35%. Europe's Stoxx 600 index added 0.22%. Italy-listed shares of Ferrari revved up 8% after the luxury automaker reported a 21% year-on-year jump in net profit for 2024. December's job openings shrinkU.S. job openings in December tumbled to 7.6 million, the lowest since September, and below the Dow Jones estimate for 8 million, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its monthly\u00a0Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The report comes just a few days ahead of the nonfarm payrolls data for January. That is expected to show an addition of 169,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%. [PRO] An under-the-radar opportunity in AIArk Invest's Cathie Wood thinks there's an under-the-radar investing opportunity in the artificial intelligence boom, and one of her high-conviction bets is up nearly 10% for the year so far. Wood also told CNBC she's moving away from hardware, and looking at software plays in the artificial intelligence space. The Fed could find itself in a policy Catch-22 if tariffs spike inflation and slow growth When Trump launched tariffs in his first term, inflation was low and the Fed was raising rates as it sought a \"neutral\" level. A\u00a0manufacturing recession ensued\u00a0in 2019. This time around, the targeted tariffs that Trump had previously used have been replaced by the\u00a0threat of blanket duties \u2014 which could slow growth and raise prices, putting the U.S. Federal Reserve in a position where it has to weigh economic expansion against controlling inflation.

Apple's earnings report shows why I always say \"own it, don't trade it.\" Where it has launched Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 sells better. High-margin services revenues was better. Mac better. Accessories better. Europe better. India better. Expanding gross margins helped make the numbers, too. Shares are up about 4% Friday.  2. China is still a question mark for Apple, though. Revenues down 11% there in the quarter. Apple Intelligence still needs government approval to launch. Rivals Huawei and Xiaomi can access the AI from buzzy Chinese startup DeepSeek. What can Apple get to reverse its fortunes in China? Will Baidu be its AI partner? 3. The U.S. government is looking into whether DeepSeek used third-parties in Singapore to acquire Nvidia chips that Washington has banned in China, according to Bloomberg News. Club name Nvidia says it plays by the rules in Singapore, and that its revenue from the island country does not indicate diversion.  4. We know Tesla, Club stock Meta and Oracle want all the high-end Nvidia chips they can get, even with DeepSeek's emergence. We don't know about Club names Alphabet or Amazon, which both report next week. What if one of the two says we are reassessing our orders for Nvidia's next-gen AI platform Blackwell? What happens to the stock? What if Amazon, another Club holding, says it's leaning into using AMD? I made a call on Nvidia stock for Club members yesterday.  5. Geopolitics remain part of the Nvidia dilemma. Does DeepSeek have a juicer that can make 10 glasses of orange juice out of a single orange, or does it have 10 government-subsidized juicers that it just won't tell us about? If it is 10 juicers, I worry that President Donald Trump will just ban all semiconductor exports to China.  6. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, currently set to take effect Saturday, may exclude oil, the president told reporters Thursday night. U.S. oil benchmark WTI was slightly higher Friday, to roughly $73  barrel. The U.S. dollar index strengthened, but it's still below its recent highs set earlier this month.  7. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all set to open higher Friday. Stock futures held onto their gains after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge matched expectations for December. The PCE index rose 0.3% month over month and, when excluding food and energy, 2.8% on an annual basis.  8. Intel showed some cost discipline and improved cash flow in its quarterly results. But the fourth quarter is typically strong for them, and there might have been some pull-through ahead of higher tariffs on Chinese imports. The PC market is weak. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo cut their price targets on the struggling chip stock. Shares added more than 1% Friday.  9. Atlassian shares jumped almost 20% on the back of a very good quarter. The company, which trades under the ticker TEAM, makes pure enterprise software that makes it easier to share\u00a0and simplify. Seems unstoppable. 10. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' non-opioid painkiller Journavx, which blocks pain signals sent to the brain at their origin. This drug could be a blockbuster, and it's been on my radar for a while now. Vertex shares climbed about 3% Friday.  Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

The main topic Huang and Trump are expected to discuss is U.S. artificial intelligence policy, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the plans. China's DeepSeek is likely to be part of the discussion, but the meeting is seen as a way for both leaders to get to know one another, the sources said. Top technology CEOs have embraced Trump in recent months to a degree not seen in his first administration. But this is the first meeting between Huang and Trump since the president started his second term last week. Many other industry leaders were at Trump's inauguration. They included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. They also donated to the event either individually or through their company. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has emerged as one of Trump's top advisors, after heavily financing his campaign. Musk is implementing policy for the Trump administration through his oversight of an outside advisory council, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. On Inauguration Day, Huang visited Nvidia offices in China. Trump and Huang have a lot to discuss as Nvidia, now the third most-valuable U.S. company, faces several regulatory challenges related to international demand for its AI chips. The most powerful Nvidia AI chips have export restrictions preventing them from going to countries like China and Russia \u2014 and soon a host of other countries. CNBC has confirmed U.S. chip restrictions on China are currently being evaluated by the White House. The two will also likely discuss the so-called diffusion rules that were announced by the Biden administration in its final days. The rules severely limit chips sales overseas and prompted a sharp response from both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They're expected go into effect this year, but Trump has the power to reverse them. Huang and Trump are also expected to discuss investments in U.S. chip production, the sources said, as the Commerce Department looks to revamp the previous administration's CHIPS Act that subsidized companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to build new chip foundries on U.S. soil. Most of Nvidia's chips are fabricated at the most advanced factories in Taiwan, which are operated by TSMC. WATCH: DeepSeek and China's broad tech advancement Got a confidential news tip?

Hey, anything's possible,\" he said. \"But if you had to design the most punitive way to bring down the price of this great stock, you'd invent something like DeepSeek.\" Earlier this week, investors were stunned to find out DeepSeek developed an AI model that it said cost $6 million to make \u2014 significantly less than what its peers spend on such programs. The company also claimed that the model could outperform that of industry favorite OpenAI. Wall Street concluded Big Tech may not need to spend as much money on highly-advanced chips from Nvidia, which until now seemed like the only option for companies looking to dominate in the AI world. Worries of lower earnings sent Nvidia shares plummeting, with the stock losing nearly $600 billion in one session, the largest single-day drop in market history. Cramer conceded that investors' response is logical if DeepSeek's model actually cost so little to make, forcing Nvidia to bring down prices. But he said there's a possibility that DeepSeek spent more on its program than investors believe, referencing a new report from SemiAnalysis,\u00a0a semiconductor research and consulting firm. SemiAnalysis suggested the way DeepSeek framed the development of the new model is misleading, saying the company could have actually spent more than $500 million. Cramer was also skeptical that executives at tech giants like Meta, Tesla and Oracle would have invested so much money in Nvidia without performing proper due diligence. DeepSeek wasn't a secret, he continued, it just received a lot of attention this week. \"I think the SemiAnalysis piece is spot on,\" he said. \"It may just be one more long knife aimed at Nvidia, and nothing more.\" Nvidia declined to comment. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to request for comment. Click here to download\u00a0Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing\u00a0at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

We had just reviewed Eaton's very good \u2014 though not excellent \u2014 quarterly results, and I was struck about how content I was with something I viewed as a big liability three weeks ago: that only one-fifth of this old-fashioned industrial company catered to data centers. And now, the electrical equipment provider is saved by having not that much data-center exposure when, only a few weeks ago, I wished the relationship had been four-fifths data center and one-fifth manufacturing reshoring.

U.S. companies created 183,000 jobs last month, according to the ADP's monthly data. That was slightly more than the upwardly revised 176,000 in December and much more than the 150,000 economists were expecting. Will Friday's government employment report show this kind of strength? 2. Wall Street was looking at a lower open as shares of Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices sank after their earnings reports. Wednesday morning: bond yields dipped, gold hit a record high, and oil slumped 1%. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all higher Tuesday. 3. Alphabet dropped a bombshell that it needs to spend a much higher-than-expected $75 billion for cloud and data center in 2025. Seems like concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek curtailing AI chip demand are more of a side show. Good news for Club names Nvidia and Broadcom, which makes TPUs for Google.

Wall Street was heading for a muted open after Friday's jobs report showed lackluster nonfarm payrolls growth but a lower unemployment rate. The S&P 500 closed higher Thursday, extending its winning streak to three straight sessions. 2. The U.S. economy added just 143,000 nonfarm jobs in January. The jobless rate dipped to 4%. December nonfarm payrolls got a big upward revision to 307,000. Bond yields were higher after the release. Bond yields were higher after the release showed hotter than expected wage inflation. 3. Club name Amazon has more demand than it can handle. Price targets raised. Needs more equipment. Working closely with Club holding Nvidia for Blackwell chips because they can do what Amazon needs. Trying to build out others. Lumpy growth but a lot of that was the strong U.S. dollar. Still the stock was down more than 2%. Cost to serve each package still going down.

Citadel's multistrategy flagship Wellington fund rose 1.4% in January, following a 15.1% gain in 2024, according to the person, who spoke anonymously because the performance numbers are private. All five strategies used in the fund \u2014 commodities, equities, fixed income, credit and quantitative \u2014 were positive for the month, the person said. The Miami-based firm's tactical trading fund gained 2.7% in January, while its equities fund, which uses a long/short strategy, also returned 2.7%, said the person. Meanwhile, Citadel's global fixed-income fund returned 1.9%. Citadel, which had $65 billion in assets under management as the year began, declined to comment. Markets experienced violent price swings last month as investors grew wary of President Donald Trump's protectionist policies. At the end of the month, an artificial intelligence competitor out of China called DeepSeek caused a massive sell-off in Nvidia and upended other megacap tech stocks. The S&P 500 climbed 2.7% in January and is up 1.9% in 2025 following a stellar two-year run in 2023 and 2024. The equity benchmark scored a second consecutive annual gain above 20% last year, and the two-year gain of 53% is the best since 1997 and 1998, when it jumped nearly 66%.\u00a0 Before the new administration took office Jan. 20, Griffin criticized the steep tariffs Trump vowed to implement, saying they could result in crony capitalism. The Citadel founder said domestic companies could enjoy a short-term benefit by having their competitors weakened. Longer term, however, tariffs do more harm to corporate America and the economy as companies lose competitiveness and productivity, Griffin said.  Got a confidential news tip?

Markets were rocked this week after DeepSeek claimed its large language model outperforms OpenAI's but cost a fraction of the price to train. However, questions were soon raised over the provenance of the semiconductors used to build DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model given U.S. restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips in China.\u00a0 Bloomberg on Friday reported that U.S. officials were investigating whether DeepSeek had bought advanced semiconductors from chipmaker Nvidia via third parties in Singapore.  A Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC Monday that the chips used by DeepSeek were fully export-compliant.\u00a0DeepSeek was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. \"We expect US companies, like Nvidia, to comply with US export controls and our domestic legislation. Our customs and law enforcement agencies will continue to work closely with their US counterparts,\" MTI said in its statement.  \"We have always upheld the rule of law, and acted decisively and firmly against individuals and companies that flout the rules.\" In its third-quarter results published in November, Nvidia said that Singapore accounts for almost 22% of its revenue but added that: \"most shipments associated with Singapore revenue were to locations other than Singapore and shipments to Singapore were insignificant.\" MTI cited Nvidia's comments in its Saturday statement and said the chipmaker said there was no reason to believe that DeepSeek had obtained any export-controlled products via Singapore.  \"Singapore is an international business hub. Major US and European companies have significant operations here. Nvidia has explained that many of these customers use their business entities in Singapore to purchase chips for products destined for the US and other Western countries,\" MTI added.  \u2014 CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.

        "Summary": "Markets \n\n\n Hot Stocks \n\n\n Fear & Greed Index \n\n\n \n            Latest Market News \n\n\n \n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n \n            An electronics store in Tokyo has apologized after hundreds of Chinese buyers who flocked there to get their hands on the latest Nvidia gaming chips brought mayhem to the neighborhood.\n     \n            The ensuing commotion, which went viral on Japanese social media, was a physical manifestation of the impact of the US-China tech war on gamers looking for an upgrade and resellers catering to them.\n     \n            Up to 400 people showed up last week in Akihabara \u2014 a popular shopping district for buying video games, manga and anime \u2014 hoping to snap up the US chipmaker\u2019s latest series of GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, according to the electronics chain PC Koubou.\n     \n            The ruckus caused by buyers obstructing the pavement and trespassing on a nearby property eventually forced the outlet to cancel the sale. It apologized earlier this week.\n     \n            \u201cWe formally present our deepest apologies for the great commotion that has burdened and worried our customers, neighboring communities and related parties,\u201d PC Koubou said in a statement on Monday.\n     \n            Taizo Hashida, a director at Unitcom, the company that owns the chain, told CNN on Wednesday that about 90% of the hopeful buyers were Chinese-speaking customers.\n     \n            The new graphics cards, launched on January 30 and sought after feverishly by game enthusiasts, promise better processing speeds and image rendering ability. That means they provide better visuals and a smoother gaming experience.\n     \n            But the series is not available in China, which is subject to US export restrictions on advanced computer chips. The measures are part of Washington\u2019s efforts to prevent its rivals from accessing the advanced technology that can power artificial intelligence (AI) systems and weapons development.\n     \n            Chinese gamers say they are getting what they call a \u201ccastrated version\u201d of Nvidia\u2019s latest release. The company has created a modified version with a slower AI component exclusively for the Chinese market. The discrepancy has driven up demand for the current generation in places like Japan.\n     \n            Gil Luria, head of tech research at investment group D.A. Davidson, said the US restrictions apply to the latest cards because they can be used to develop AI tools.\n     \n            \u201cFor diehard gamers, the difference between the allowed chips and restricted chips can be meaningful, which is why they may be seeking them in other markets,\u201d he said.\n     \n            Last Thursday, PC Koubou offered to sell dozens of the GeForce series, including 10 of the top RTX 5090 chips and 47 RTX 5080 chips, to those who had won a lottery at its Akihabara store. But the turnout far exceeded their expectations, it said in the Monday statement.\n     \n            Videos circulated online showed chaotic scenes near the store, with hundreds of buyers squeezing into a narrow pavement and spilling onto the road.\n     \n            Calls by the staff to line up in order were ignored, with at least one man climbing over a fence to enter a nearby kindergarten, footage showed. A sign hung on a fence at the kindergarten was snapped in half, local media reported.\n     \n            The store called off the sale and launched a two-day online lottery for Tuesday, with the result to be announced later.\n     \n            It was not the first time Nvidia had tailored a gaming chip for the Chinese market in a bid to comply with US export controls.\n     \n            Last year, Nvidia started selling a China-focused RTX 4090D, which was 5% slower in gaming performance compared to its international version RTX 4090, Reuters reported.\n     \n            The current version RTX 5090 sold outside China can handle 3,352 trillion operations per second (TOPS). Its equivalent in the Chinese market, the RTX 5090D, offers just 2,375 TOPS, making it about 29% less powerful, according to the specifications on the website. Both versions share the same specifications in other areas.\n     \n            The RTX 5090 chip is priced at $1,999 in the US, compared to about $2,600 in Japan. Its modified cousin RTX 5090D is sold at about $2,270 in China.\n     \n            Demand in China for the latest generation cards is so high that Chinese resellers are already advertising the chips bought outside the country for up to $5,700 on Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao.\n     \nRelated article\nBiden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia\n \n            On Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, there are numerous posts asking for or offering tips to buy the chips overseas.\n     \n            One user said he wanted to buy from South Korea. \u201cTell me about the risk. Is there anything I should watch out for?\u201d he wrote.\n     \n            Another user, who claimed to be a student in Thailand, said he wanted to make some money to support his studies.\n     \n            \u201cStudent in Thailand hoping to earn some money for my tuition fee,\u201d the person wrote. \u201cIf I bring some RTX 5090s back, will there be rich men who will take them?\u201d\n     \n            CNN has reached out to Nvidia for comment.\n     \n  Joyce Jiang contributed reporting.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The new feature is the latest sign that Meta is looking to capitalize on TikTok's uncertain future in the U.S. after it briefly went dark earlier this month. The popular short-form video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, could be banned for good on April 5 and is still unavailable on the Apple and Google app stores. The pause feature is currently available to a small group of users around the globe, Meta said. The company was unable to specify when it will roll out more broadly. Previously, Instagram users have only been able to pause videos on Instagram Reels by tapping and holding on their screen, requiring more work than simply tapping the screen to pause on TikTok. Previously, one tap on Instagram Reels would mute a video's audio, but the video would continue to play. On Thursday, CNBC was able to pause Instagram Reels videos with a single tap. Thousands of users have left comments and taken to other social media to lobby for a Reels pause button. \"Hello @instagram, can I please request a pause button on reels?? sincerely, a grieving former TikTok scroller,\" one user posted on social media site X while TikTok was offline for a few hours in the U.S. earlier this month. Besides the Reels pause button, Meta this month has announced a new video editing app called Edits that will compete directly with ByteDance's CapCut editing app. Edits will launch in February, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said in a post. Meta is also paying creators to promote Instagram on TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts and other short-form video platforms, CNBC reported Sunday. Shares of Meta are up slightly on Thursday, a day after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines. \"We're going to learn what's going to happen with TikTok, and regardless of that, I expect Reels on Instagram and Facebook to continue growing,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts Wednesday.

Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations: Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 14% from $1.36 billion a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $9.1 million, or a penny a share. In the prior year, Snap recorded a fourth-quarter net loss of $248 million, or 15 cents a share. Snap said it expects first-quarter revenue to come in between $1.325 billion and $1.36 billion. The midpoint of that range is $1.34 billion, higher than Wall Street projections of $1.33 billion. However, Snap's first-quarter adjusted earnings will fall in the range of $40 million to $75 million, below analyst expectations of $78.5 million. In an investor letter, Snap attributed the guidance to \"investment plans for the quarter ahead.\" First-quarter adjusted operating expenses will grow in the range of 11% to 12% year over year due to hiring, legal-related costs, and \"a seasonal shift of marketing expenses into Q1 relative to the prior year,\" Snap said. \"As we look ahead to 2025, we see additional opportunities to invest productively in scaling our business given the foundational improvements we have made to our ad platform and the momentum we have established in our go to market initiatives,\" particularly in the segment focused on small and medium-sized businesses, Snap said in the letter. \"Our investment plans for 2025 reflect this optimism, alongside a strong commitment to make further financial progress towards profitability as we scale.\" Additionally, the company said it committed $5 million to \"support communities and team members\" affected by the recent Los Angeles wildfires and that it anticipates making \"further commitments over time.\" In September, the New Mexico attorney general\u00a0filed\u00a0a lawsuit against Snap that alleged the company's Snapchat app's design and recommendation systems \"openly foster and promote illicit sexual material involving children and facilitate sextortion and the\u00a0trafficking\u00a0of children, drugs, and guns.\" Earlier in January, Snap shares\u00a0dropped\u00a0after the Federal Trade Commission said it would refer a complaint against the company related to its My AI chatbot to the Department of Justice. Last week, Meta reported fourth-quarter results that beat on revenue and earnings and reiterated its plans to spend heavily on AI-related investments. Alphabet on Tuesday beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Pinterest reports earnings Thursday followed by Reddit next week. Snap said daily active users for the first quarter will be 459 million, topping analyst expectations of 458.3 million. The company said its Snapchat+ service now has 14 million subscribers, up from the 12 million it reported during the third quarter. The service, which debuted in 2022, makes up the bulk of what Snap calls \"other revenue.\" That unit grew 131% year over year in 2024 and has an \"annualized revenue run rate of well over $500 million,\" the company said. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a Tuesday call with analysts that he's pleased with the user response to Snapchat+ and the company may consider raising its subscription price, which currently costs $3.99 a month. Spiegel also commented about China-based DeepSeek's breakthrough AI model that was allegedly cheaper and quicker to build and operate compared to other similar software from tech giants like Meta, Alphabet and OpenAI. DeepSeek's AI model shows that \"Capital is not a long-term moat in the technology business,\" Spiegel said. \"It's been really inspiring to see the innovation there,\" Spiegel said. \"I think it validates our view that a lot of these models are going to continue to be commoditized over time, more efficient to run.\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts last week that his company was still digesting some of DeepSeek's capabilities, but added that it's \"probably too early to really have a strong opinion on what this means for the trajectory around infrastructure and CapEx,\" suggesting that Meta won't slash its AI spending anytime soon. Regarding whether Snap has seen any impact from TikTok's potential ban in the U.S., Spiegel said \"The overall environment of uncertainty is benefiting our business.\" He said that both advertisers and creators are looking to \"diversify\" the social platforms they rely on, and Snap is helping them with their planning. Snap said Ajit Mohan will become chief business officer after previously serving as president of the Asia-Pacific region. Before joining Snap in 2023, Mohan was the vice president and managing director of India at Meta. WATCH: Meta and Microsoft defend AI capex spend post-DeepSeek Got a confidential news tip?

Hey, anything's possible,\" he said. \"But if you had to design the most punitive way to bring down the price of this great stock, you'd invent something like DeepSeek.\" Earlier this week, investors were stunned to find out DeepSeek developed an AI model that it said cost $6 million to make \u2014 significantly less than what its peers spend on such programs. The company also claimed that the model could outperform that of industry favorite OpenAI. Wall Street concluded Big Tech may not need to spend as much money on highly-advanced chips from Nvidia, which until now seemed like the only option for companies looking to dominate in the AI world. Worries of lower earnings sent Nvidia shares plummeting, with the stock losing nearly $600 billion in one session, the largest single-day drop in market history. Cramer conceded that investors' response is logical if DeepSeek's model actually cost so little to make, forcing Nvidia to bring down prices. But he said there's a possibility that DeepSeek spent more on its program than investors believe, referencing a new report from SemiAnalysis,\u00a0a semiconductor research and consulting firm. SemiAnalysis suggested the way DeepSeek framed the development of the new model is misleading, saying the company could have actually spent more than $500 million. Cramer was also skeptical that executives at tech giants like Meta, Tesla and Oracle would have invested so much money in Nvidia without performing proper due diligence. DeepSeek wasn't a secret, he continued, it just received a lot of attention this week. \"I think the SemiAnalysis piece is spot on,\" he said. \"It may just be one more long knife aimed at Nvidia, and nothing more.\" Nvidia declined to comment. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to request for comment. Click here to download\u00a0Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing\u00a0at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

The main topic Huang and Trump are expected to discuss is U.S. artificial intelligence policy, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the plans. China's DeepSeek is likely to be part of the discussion, but the meeting is seen as a way for both leaders to get to know one another, the sources said. Top technology CEOs have embraced Trump in recent months to a degree not seen in his first administration. But this is the first meeting between Huang and Trump since the president started his second term last week. Many other industry leaders were at Trump's inauguration. They included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. They also donated to the event either individually or through their company. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has emerged as one of Trump's top advisors, after heavily financing his campaign. Musk is implementing policy for the Trump administration through his oversight of an outside advisory council, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. On Inauguration Day, Huang visited Nvidia offices in China. Trump and Huang have a lot to discuss as Nvidia, now the third most-valuable U.S. company, faces several regulatory challenges related to international demand for its AI chips. The most powerful Nvidia AI chips have export restrictions preventing them from going to countries like China and Russia \u2014 and soon a host of other countries. CNBC has confirmed U.S. chip restrictions on China are currently being evaluated by the White House. The two will also likely discuss the so-called diffusion rules that were announced by the Biden administration in its final days. The rules severely limit chips sales overseas and prompted a sharp response from both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They're expected go into effect this year, but Trump has the power to reverse them. Huang and Trump are also expected to discuss investments in U.S. chip production, the sources said, as the Commerce Department looks to revamp the previous administration's CHIPS Act that subsidized companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to build new chip foundries on U.S. soil. Most of Nvidia's chips are fabricated at the most advanced factories in Taiwan, which are operated by TSMC. WATCH: DeepSeek and China's broad tech advancement Got a confidential news tip?

Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting Amazon to report ad revenue of $17.4 billion. The online retail giant revealed its latest advertising sales results Thursday as part of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company said fourth-quarter sales were $187.79 billion, which was ahead of analysts' estimates of $187.3 billion. But the company's shares fell on disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Amazon's online advertising unit has grown considerably over the years and is the third-biggest platform in the global digital advertising market, trailing Alphabet and Meta, respectively, according to data provided to CNBC by Emarketer. Meta on Jan. 29 reported fourth-quarter sales that rose 21% year over year to $48.39 billion. Alphabet reported its fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday and said its Google advertising sales and YouTube ad revenue came in at $72.46 billion and $10.47 billion, respectively, representing an 11% and 14% increase from the prior year. As part of Microsoft's latest quarterly earnings, revealed Jan. 29, the enterprise tech giant said its search and news advertising sales increased 21% year over year. Microsoft does not disclose that unit's specific quarterly sales figures. Also on Thursday, Pinterest reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.15 billion, representing an 18% increase from the prior year during the same period. Snap on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter sales rose 14% year over year to $1.56 billion. Reddit will report its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday.Watch: Growth in AWS is key to Amazon's earnings story  Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The capex figure came in ahead of the $59.73 billion consensus estimate for Google, according to Visible Alpha. On its earnings call, Alphabet said it expects $16 billion to $18 billion of those expenses to come in the first quarter. Overall, the expenditures will go toward \"technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking,\" finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said. Alphabet's announcement came alongside a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report. Shares fell 8% after the company topped Wall Street's earnings estimates by 2 cents per share, but fell short on revenue expectations. Alphabet and its megacap tech rivals are rushing to build out their data centers with next-generation AI infrastructure, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Last month, Meta said it plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year as part of its AI push. Microsoft has committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures in its current fiscal year. The recent rise of China's DeepSeek open-source models has led to some concerns about whether companies need to invest as heavily in their buildouts. Those fears rocked financial markets early last week, spurring a sell-off that contributed to the worst one-day market value loss for a company in history. Many technology CEOs have called attention to the Chinese startup and its implications for U.S.-based tools. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said DeepSeek is showing \"real innovations,\" while Palantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC last week that competing AI models means the U.S. needs an \"all-country effort\" to develop the technology faster. In addition to infrastructure purchases, Alphabet said it expects headcount growth in 2025 \"in key investment areas such as AI and cloud.\" WATCH: Alphabet's AI drug development could be tailwind Got a confidential news tip?

Trump on Saturday signed executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Trump on Monday agreed to pause tariffs on Mexico for one month, while the import taxes remain in place for China and Canada. An overlooked provision in the orders eliminates the \"de minimis\" trade loophole relied on heavily by Chinese online retailers like PDD's Temu and Shein. The de minimis exemption allows packages worth less than $800 to be shipped into the U.S. duty free. It's been a critical tool for Temu and Shein as they look to grow their presence in the U.S. by offering rock-bottom prices on everything from clothes and furniture to electronics and home decor. Lawmakers have zeroed in on de minimis in recent years, arguing it gives Chinese companies an unfair advantage by allowing them to bypass tariffs. Officials have also said de minimis packages are \"subject to minimal documentation and inspection,\" raising product safety concerns. Trade organizations and advocacy groups have also pushed Trump to curb de minimis shipments because they argue that it has allowed shipments of fentanyl to enter the U.S. Without that tax advantage, it's unclear if Temu, Shein and other Chinese e-commerce platforms will be able to keep prices low and sustain the explosive growth they've seen in the U.S. in recent years. Temu and Shein have previously said their business models don't rely on de minimis. Shein and Temu have opened distribution centers in the U.S., allowing sellers in China to ship goods to the U.S. and store them in local warehouses. It's more in line with Amazon's logistics network, which spans hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. That may not be enough to soften the blow of the removal of de minimis. In a note to clients on Sunday, analysts at Citi estimated Temu's local warehouse program remains a small portion of its overall business. \"Although Temu's efforts in ramping up its local warehouse/semi-managed model over the past year could help mitigate some of the tariff risks, we estimate the [gross merchandise volume] from local warehouses might have contributed 20%+ to U.S. GMV by end-2024,\" the analysts wrote. They added, \"We believe the new tariffs will still have a negative read-through to Temu's growth in 2025 and beyond.\" The end of de minimis could also dampen Temu and Shein's digital ad spending, as they look to \"offset concerns on rising product costs,\" Bank of America analysts wrote Monday in a note to clients. Shein and Temu have been significant contributors to Meta's advertising revenue in recent quarters. The companies have gone on a digital marketing blitz in an attempt to reach more American consumers. \"Meta's 10-K indicates that revenue from China-based advertisers represented 11% of Family of Apps revenue (vs 6% in 2023), and we estimate Temu and Shein exposure could be 2-4% of ad spend for Google and Meta,\" the Bank of America analysts wrote.

In December, the company gave access to developers and trusted testers, as well as wrapping some features into Google products, but this is a \"general release,\" according to Google. The suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is billed as a \"workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale,\" as well as 2.0 Pro Experimental for coding performance, and 2.0 Flash-Lite, which the company calls its \"most cost-efficient model yet.\" Gemini Flash costs developers 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash-Lite, its more cost-effective version, costs 0.75 of a cent for the same. Tokens refer to each individual unit of data that the model processes. The continued releases are part of a broader strategy for Google of\u00a0investing heavily into AI agents as the AI arms race heats up among tech giants and startups alike. Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are also moving toward agentic AI, or models that can complete complex multistep tasks on a user's behalf, rather than a user having to walk them through every individual step. \"Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,\" Google wrote in a December blog post, adding that Gemini 2.0 has \"new advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use,\" and that the family of models \"will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\" Anthropic, the\u00a0Amazon-backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, is a key competitor in the race to develop AI agents. In October, Anthropic\u00a0said\u00a0its AI agents were able to use computers like humans to complete complex tasks. Anthropic's computer use capability allows its technology to interpret what's on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said. The tool can \"use computers in basically the same way that we do,\" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time. He said it can do tasks with \"tens or even hundreds of steps.\" OpenAI released a\u00a0similar feature recently called Operator that will automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations and ordering groceries. The\u00a0Microsoft-backed startup described Operator as \"an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.\" Earlier this week, OpenAI introduced Deep Research, which allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports and analyze questions and topics of the user's choice. Google in December launched a similar tool of the same name \u2014\u00a0Deep Research \u2014\u00a0which acts as a \"research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports on your behalf.\" CNBC first reported in December that Google would\u00a0introduce several AI features early in 2025. \"In history, you don't always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a strategy meeting at the time. \"I think that's what 2025 is all about.\" Got a confidential news tip?

About 35% reported being deceived by fake content online. However, a larger 41% reported they had encountered content that was real yet misleading and 22% said they had shared information that turned out to be fake. \n \n            The findings come as a growing number of teenagers adopt artificial intelligence. A September Common Sense study showed that seven in 10 teenagers had at least tried generative AI.\n     \n            Two years after ChatGPT\u2019s launch, the AI arena has grown increasingly crowded, with DeepSeek\u2019s meteoric arrival on Monday. But the top models are still prone to AI hallucinations, according to a July 2024 study from Cornell, the University of Washington and the University of Waterloo \u2014 meaning even the top AI platforms still create false information out of thin air.\n     \n            And teenagers who encountered fake online content were more likely to say AI would exacerbate their verification of online information, according to Wednesday\u2019s study from Common Sense, a media and tech nonprofit.\n \n            The survey also pressed teenagers about their thoughts on major tech corporations, including Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok and Microsoft. Nearly half of teenagers don\u2019t trust Big Tech to make responsible decisions about how they use AI, according to the study.\n     \n            \u201cThe ease and speed at which generative AI allows everyday users to spread unreliable claims and inauthentic media may exacerbate teens\u2019 existing low levels of trust in institutions like the media and government,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s study said.\n     \n            Teenagers\u2019 distrust of Big Tech echo a growing dissatisfaction with major tech companies in the United States. American adults also have to contend with increases in misleading or altogether fake content, exacerbated by the erosion of already limited digital guardrails.\n     \n            Since acquiring Twitter in 2022 and renaming the platform X, Elon Musk has gutted its moderation teams, allowed misinformation and hate speech to spread and reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, among other moves. Recently, Meta moved to replace third-party fact-checkers with Community Notes, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted will lead to more harmful content appearing across Facebook, Instagram and its other platforms.\n     \n            \u201cTeens\u2019 perceptions of the accuracy of online content signal a distrust in digital platforms, pointing to an opportunity for educational interventions on misinformation for teens,\u201d the study found, adding that there\u2019s also a \u201cneed for tech companies to prioritize transparency and develop features that enhance the credibility of the content shared on their platforms.\u201d\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But cheese fans quickly caught a hole in a previous version last week.\n     \n            The AI-generated copy in the commercial claimed that Gouda accounts \u201cfor 50 to 60 percent of the world\u2019s consumption.\u201d An X user quickly pointed out that that\u2019s incorrect. (\u201cCheddar & mozzarella would like a word,\u201d the user added.)\n     \n            Though widely used since the release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in late 2022, generative AI still is prone to churning out inaccurate and oftentimes wacky results. Google\u2019s AI-generated search results came under fire when it provided misleading information, such as falsely claiming that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Other users pointed out last year the tool recommended adding glue on pizza to help the cheese stick.\n     \n            Google is in the middle of a push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across its suite of products in a race to keep up with its US AI competitors OpenAI and Meta, as well as new competitors in China.\n     \n            On X, Google Cloud executive Jerry Dischler said that the gaffe wasn\u2019t a hallucination \u2013 which is when an AI model produces inaccurate or misleading results. Rather, he said \u201cmultiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat.\u201d\n     \n            In a statement, Google said it had updated the commercial. The statistic is erased from the commercial currently uploaded on Google-owned YouTube.\n     \n            \u201cAfter the question came up about the Gouda stat, we spoke with the owner of the Wisconsin Cheese Mart to ask him how he would handle. Following his suggestion to have Gemini rewrite the product description without the stat, we updated the UI to reflect what the business would do,\u201d a Google spokesperson said Thursday.\n     \n            When Googling \u201cgouda cheese consumption,\u201d the first result that comes up is the 50-60% statistic from a site called Cheese.com. However, it\u2019s hard to find another website that uses that number, and the statistic has long been debated on the internet.\n     \n            The Wisconsin ad was part of a series of 50 commercials from 50 different states\u2019 small businesses that show how they use Google Workspace with Gemini.\n     \nCNN\u2019s Clare Duffy contributed to this report. \n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The rule allowed international exporters to ship packages worth less than $800 inspection- and duty-free into the United States.\n     \n            Chinese e-commerce sites have built their gargantuan business models around this exemption. The relaxed restrictions and tax exemptions on cheap products has allowed more than a billion packages to pour in at a low-cost price for consumers looking for a deal on clothing to household goods.\n     \n            But the Trump administration is getting rid of the provision that made these goods so cheap and easy to access.\n     \n            \u201cIf you inspect every package, it\u2019s going to raise costs dramatically for consumers,\u201d Clark Packard, a research fellow at Cato Trade, said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to slow down the reception of goods that were bought.\u201d\n     \n            Currently, US Customs and Border Protection has the authority to open and inspect all international packages, though in practice it doesn\u2019t open every single item.\n     \n            Trump enacted 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Tuesday, adding to a wide array of tariffs that were placed on goods from the country during his first term. (The administration delayed a 25% tariff order on Canada and Mexico until March 1.) Beijing hit back with a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars and pickup trucks.\n     \n            The ramifications of a looming US-China trade war have begun to trickle in for the customers of Temu and Shein, which is headquartered in Singapore. Late on Tuesday, the US Postal Service suspended the acceptance of international parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice \u2014 but this was quickly reversed Wednesday morning when USPS announced it would continue accepting those packages.\n     \n            Although no reason was given for the initial suspension, the Postal Service suggested Wednesday that it was related to the new tariffs and the elimination of the de minimis exemption.\n     \n            The de minimis provision has been around since the 1930s, but the threshold has increased over the years. It\u2019s meant to ease trade and help out consumers, Packard told CNN.\n     \n            The exemption means buyers don\u2019t have to fill out tiresome customs paperwork or pay tariffs on small packages.\n     \nIn September 2024, the Biden administration announced it was cracking down on what it called abuse of the de minimis exemption, saying that over the past decade shipments increased from about 140 million a year to over a billion.\n     \n            The exponential increase made it more challenging to enforce trade laws and also posed challenges for American workers and businesses, upholding US consumer protections laws and combatting the fentanyl trade.\n     \n            The Trump administration said the suspension will stop shipments of fentanyl from Mexico and Canada in small packages.\n     \n            Policymakers already want to appear tough on China, said Rob Handfield, a professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University. The US also has concerns over fast fashion labor practices in China, though the administration has not specified why China is targeted.\n     \n            The de minimis exemption is why these Chinese goods are so cheap for US customers, said Christopher Tang, a professor of global supply chain management at the University of California, Los Angeles. More than 80% of total US e-commerce shipments in 2022 were de minimis imports, according to a congressional research report.\n     \nDuring the first Trump administration, \u201cconsumers bore basically 90 to 100% of the cost of a tariff,\u201d Packard said. \u201cSo, if that similar dynamic exists, consumers could expect a 10% increase if it\u2019s coming from China.\u201d\n     \n            Customs is not equipped to handle this level of change, and it could cause other delays, Handfield said.\n     \n            \u201cThe operations would be horrendous in terms of implementation,\u201d Tang said.\n     \n            Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, also noted that taking away the de minimis carve-out would impact not just Temu and Shein but also Amazon, eBay, Etsy and other retailers that ship from China.\n     \n            In 2024, Temu ran an ad during the Super Bowl (at a range of $6.5 million to $7 million for a 30-second spot) with $14 million in coupons and giveaways. The Boston-based firm \u2014 owned by PDD (PDD), the group behind Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo \u2014 paid for three ads during the game and two after the game.\n     \n            Whether that will happen at this year\u2019s Super Bowl in February is now in question.\n     \n            Cutting the exemption could significantly taper the growth of Chinese e-commerce companies, according to a Bank of America research note. That slowdown could hit their marketing budget.\n     \n            Americans are used to seeing Temu and Shein everywhere. Revenue from China-based advertisers grew from 6% of Meta\u2019s family of apps revenue to 11% in 2024, according to the company\u2019s financial reports. Bank of America estimated Temu and Shein exposure could be 2% to 4% of ad spend for Google and Meta.\n     \n            To get around the exemption\u2019s disappearance, companies can expand their warehouses in the US, Tang said. They can ship bulk amounts through customs and then reship it across the US \u2013 but customers will still have to pay the import tax. The perk: This could create more US jobs, Tang said.\n     \n            The companies could also ship products to other ASEAN countries such as Vietnam and ship it to the US there, but the extra shipping costs would also eventually trickle down to customers.\n     \n            There was more potentially bad news for Temu and Shein out of Europe Wednesday. The European Union said it would control imports of low-value products from such websites more tightly as it unveiled a number of actions to tackle \u201cthe surge of unsafe, counterfeit and otherwise non-compliant or illicit products\u201d entering the bloc.\n     \nCNN\u2019s Eric Cheung, Simone McCarthy, Olesya Dmitracova and Matt Egan contributed to this report. \n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But less than five years later, Target has dialed back its high-profile DEI program.\n     \n            In 2020, Target CEO Brian Cornell said Floyd\u2019s murder, which took place just 10 minutes from Target\u2019s headquarters, had a personal impact on him and Target employees, and Cornell vowed to reopen one of Target\u2019s stores damaged in protests against police violence.\n     \n            George Floyd \u201ccould have been one of my Target team members,\u201d Cornell later said.\n     \n            Months after the murder, Target pledged to increase its Black workforce by 20% throughout the company over three years and take other steps to \u201cadvance racial equity,\u201d including establishing an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee to \u201cfocus specifically on how we can drive lasting impact\u201d for Black employees and customers.\n     \n            The following year, Target pledged to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025, including adding more products from 500 Black-owned vendors to stores, and pledging $100 million to support Black-led nonprofits and provide scholarships to students attending HBCUs.\n     \n            Target was honored for its \u201coutstanding commitment to achieving Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)\u201d in 2022 by the Executive Leadership Council, a prominent organization of global Black CEOs. Cornell accepted the award for Target at a star-studded gala.\n     \n            Cornell defended Target\u2019s \u201cbold commitments\u201d to DEI in 2023, saying they were helping Target\u2019s business.\n     \n            \u201cThat focus on diversity and inclusion and equity has fueled much of our growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things we\u2019ve done from a DE&I standpoint \u2014 it\u2019s adding value, it\u2019s helping us drive sales, it\u2019s building greater engagement with both our teams and our guests. And those are just the right things for our business today.\u201d\n     \n            But Target has now shifted its message. The company is the poster child for corporate America\u2019s change on DEI and direct public commitments to advance progress for Black Americans and racial minorities. Because Target was so vocal in its diversity efforts in recent years, the company\u2019s shift has alienated some loyal customers and suppliers.\n     \n            Target recently announced it was ending its pledge to increase its Black workforce by 20% and its executive racial equity committee. Target said it was \u201cfurther evaluating\u201d corporate partnerships and changing its \u201csupplier diversity\u201d team, focused on bringing in Black-owned and diverse suppliers, to a \u201csupplier engagement\u201d team working more broadly on including small businesses without specific regard to race. Target will also stop participating in external diversity-focused surveys, including one from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.\n     \n            A spokesperson for Target said Target was on track to meet its prior workforce diversity goals and financial commitments to Black suppliers.\n     \n            Gone from Target\u2019s announcement were prior vows to directly advance equality for Black people or any representation goals or financial targets, instead replaced by a new company strategy called \u201cBelonging at the Bullseye.\u201d The spokesperson said Target first introduced this concept to employees last year.\n     \n            \u201cWe remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion,\u201d Target said. \u201cBelonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.\u201d\n     \n            Target is altering its approach in response to political, legal and social changes. They include opposition from right-wing activists, lawsuits from conservative legal groups, demand from conservative-leaning customers and other factors.\n     \n            President Donald Trump last month also placed employees in any federal diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility offices on leave, and the Trump administration plans to take further aim at diversity programs. It\u2019s not yet clear how this will impact Target and other large companies.\n     \n            Target stressed in its statement the need for \u201cstaying in step with the evolving external landscape,\u201d a hint at how the tide has shifted since its pledges in 2020.\n     \n            Target is joining a growing list of companies changing or ending their DEI programs, such as Amazon, Meta, Walmart, McDonald\u2019s and others.\n     \n            Target\u2019s change is symbolic of a broader pivot across corporate America.\n     \n            In 2020 and 2021, companies raced to add DEI roles and chief diversity officers, made lofty commitments to racial justice and invested in programs and organizations to support Blacks and other racial minorities. In 2020, companies spent an estimated $7.5 billion on DEI-related efforts, such as employee resource groups, according to a McKinsey study.\n \n            But opposition to companies\u2019 efforts began to emerge on the right.\n     \n            Bud Light was a potent warning on the risks of LGBTQ-driven marketing campaigns. In 2023, Bud Light\u2019s parent company A-B InBev lost as much as $1.4 billion in sales because of backlash to Bud Light\u2019s brief partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n     \n            Target that year also became embroiled in the political culture wars over gender and sexual orientation.\n     \n            Target faced a pressure campaign from some prominent right-wing activists, Republican political leaders and conservative media outlets over its Pride Month merchandise.\n     \n            Opponents focused their attention on a women\u2019s swimsuit sold at Target that was described as \u201ctuck friendly\u201d for its ability to conceal male genitalia. Misinformation spread on social media that it was marketed to children, which it was not.\n     \n            Republican attorneys general in several states wrote to Target warning that merchandise in its Pride Month collection could violate their states\u2019 child protection laws.\n     \n            The campaign became hostile, with violent threats levied against Target employees and instances of damaged products and displays in stores. Target opted to remove certain items that caused the most \u201cvolatile\u201d reaction from opponents, which Target said was done to protect its workers\u2019 safety.\n     \n            Target\u2019s response frustrated some supporters of gay and transgender rights, who said the company caved to bigoted pressure.\n     \n            Target\u2019s quarterly sales fell for the first time in six years following Pride Month in 2023. \u201cThe strong reaction to this year\u2019s Pride assortment\u201d impacted sales, said Christina Hennington, Target\u2019s chief growth officer.\n     \n            Ryan Wilson, an Atlanta business leader and co-founder of The Gathering Spot, a members-only club for young professionals, said that Target and other companies had violated core \u201cvalues\u201d they espoused.\n     \n            He believes Target will lose support from minority customers.\n     \n            Still, there is a divide among some Black leaders and Black Target suppliers about how hard to punish Target.\n     \n            Nina Turner, a progressive political leader and founder of We Are Somebody, a worker advocacy group, called for a Target boycott.\n     \n            \u201cThere\u2019s power in our purchase,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe should not spend a dime at Target stores.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that Target is headquartered where the George Floyd uprising happened,\u201d she said. \u201cHow quickly they forget and reverse course.\u201d\n     \n            But others appear unsure of an immediate boycott. On Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement saying it is talking to Target about its diversity plans. Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s group, the National Action Network, will conduct a 90-day review of companies before potential decisions on a boycott.\n     \n            Melissa Butler, founder of the startup beauty brand Lip Bar, said a boycott could hurt Black-owned brands like hers, but she understood customers\u2019 frustration with Target.\n     \n            \u201cA lot of my customers shop us at Target and they were asking, \u2018what\u2019s going on, what does this mean for The Lip Bar?\u2019\u201d she told CNN.\n     \n            \u201cIn our eight years in Target, the relationship has been great and we have grown a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cTarget has historically been a brand champion for small businesses, women owned businesses, Black owned businesses\u2026It feels like wait, what\u2019s happening? Even Target is turning their back?\u201d\n     \n            Just because Target is scaling back their DEI commitments doesn\u2019t mean it is going to be ending relationships with businesses owned by people of color, Butler said.\n     \n            A Target spokesperson said that the company was proud of its wide-ranging assortment and partnerships, including Black-owned and minority-owned products. Target will \u201ccontinue to aim to create joyful experiences through an assortment of products and services that help all guests feel seen and celebrated.\u201d\n     \n            Target\u2019s recent changes to its diversity and inclusion programs have also angered some longtime LGBTQ supporters.\n     \n            Twin Cities Pride, an LGBTQ advocacy group that hosts Minnesota\u2019s second largest Pride festival, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in Target\u2019s changes and dropped Target as a sponsor of this year\u2019s Pride festival after 18 years.\n     \n            Twin Cities Pride said the change would mean losing $50,000 in funding and called on supporters to help fill the funding gap. The group raised $80,000 from 1,500 people in three days. \u201cTwin Cities Pride made the bold decision to part ways with Target as a sponsor, standing firm in our commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion and equity,\u201d the organization said.\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "Summary": "Follow: \n            After nearly three weeks in the minority, Democrats have finally settled on a target to rally against: Elon Musk.\n     \n            The party and allied groups this week have shown up at the doors of agencies impacted by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, held rallies and press conferences calling the president\u2019s ally an \u201cunelected billionaire,\u201d and introduced legislation to push back on the administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate agencies and force out federal employees.\n     \n            The coordinated effort comes after weeks of Democrats grappling with how to oppose the new administration after a bruising election in which President Donald Trump made gains with key parts of the Democratic base and Republicans flipped the Senate and held the House.\n     \n            For Democrats, Musk has become both an ideal boogeyman and the face of billionaire influence in the Trump administration.\n     \nRelated article\nHow Elon Musk set off two weeks of chaos across Washington\n \n            A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 53% of voters disapproved of Musk playing a prominent role in the administration, including 90% of Democrats, 56% of independents and 19% of Republicans.\n     \n            In the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Democrats mockingly referred to Musk as the president after he helped torpedo a bipartisan spending package while President Joe Biden warned of the \u201cdangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people\u201d and the beginnings of an oligarchy in the United States. Democrats have also noted that the Tesla CEO \u2013 who spent $290 million boosting Trump and other Republicans in the 2024 election \u2013 was given a prime seat at the inauguration, along with other billionaires such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n     \n            Now, after less than three weeks, Musk\u2019s aggressive approach to scaling back the federal government has given Democrats the showdown they have been seeking.\n     \n            \u201cThis fight isn\u2019t just about USAID or the Department of Education, it\u2019s about whether the people and their elected representatives should govern, or whether the richest man in the world gets to call all the shots,\u201d Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThis is exactly the fight the Democrats need to pick to win back undecided voters.\u201d\n     \n            Democrats had been \u201csluggish\u201d in their response to Trump until this week, said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the grassroots Indivisible Project.\n     \n            \u201cOur ask for Democrats right now is, if this is a crisis, you should act like it\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe have to do things to make clear that this is absolutely not normal.\u201d\n     \n            Democratic lawmakers, liberal groups and watchdog organizations have condemned Musk\u2019s efforts to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development and reduce the size of the government by offering to pay federal workers who agree to quit through September as part of a deal Congress has not authorized. They have also railed against access by Musk\u2019s associates to the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system, which disburses funding on behalf of the federal government.\n     \nRelated article\nUSAID employees around the world will be placed on leave Friday and ordered to return to US\n \n            Critics of Musk\u2019s efforts have warned that DOGE workers now have access to the private financial data of millions of Americans and could interfere with key federal payments, including tax refunds and Social Security checks. Many have decried the lack of congressional oversight into its work, arguing that Musk and his allies could be misusing the data they have accessed.\n     \n            \u201cIs he using his access to extraordinary amounts of confidential and sensitive data to advantage his own personal interests? We don\u2019t know,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe have no reason to presume good faith on the part of any of these people because they are simultaneously working to remove every possible check or balance that could assure us that this is above board.\u201d\n     \n            Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has long criticized the role billionaires play in US politics, said that he was most concerned by the administration\u2019s efforts to gut programs unilaterally, which he said was \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cThe president wants to shut down USAID? He can have one of his Republican friends introduce legislation to do that, and it will be debated,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt will not pass, but will be debated. He does not have the unilateral power, especially through an unelected official like Mr. Musk.\u201d\n     \n            A House Oversight Committee vote to subpoena Musk, led by Democrats, was blocked by Republicans Wednesday.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s letting a small group of unelected people, secret, run rampant through the executive branch accessing the private data millions of Americans need, and God knows what they\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said of DOGE Tuesday.\n     \n            Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday introduced the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d Act, legislation aimed at DOGE and Musk that would \u201cprevent unlawful meddling in the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems and protect Americans across the country,\u201d Schumer said.\n     \n            Administration officials have said DOGE workers have \u201cread-only\u201d access to the data. A White House official said Musk and his team are working \u201cin full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.\u201d\n     \nRelated article\nTreasury says Musk\u2019s DOGE has not rejected payments in first attempt to clarify access granted to critical system\n \n            \u201cThe ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change,\u201d the official said in a statement.\n     \n            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that Musk would recuse himself in areas where he has conflicts of interest. She added that Trump was elected with a mandate to make the government more efficient.\n     \n            \u201cHe campaigned across the country with Elon Musk, vowing that Elon was going to head up the Department of Government Efficiency and the two of them, with a great team around them, were going to look at the receipts of this federal government and ensure it\u2019s accountable to American taxpayers,\u201d Leavitt said.\n     \n            Other Republicans have pushed back on Democrats\u2019 framing. In response to Democrats\u2019 rallying cry that \u201cNo one voted for Elon Musk,\u201d Vice President JD Vance wrote on X that: \u201cThey did however vote for Donald Trump who promised repeatedly to have Elon Musk root out wasteful spending in our government.\u201d\n     \n            For some Democrats, particularly those in GOP-leaning districts, Musk serves as a foil in ways the president can\u2019t.\n     \n            \u201cMy constituents, and a majority of this country, put Trump in the White House, not this unelected, weirdo billionaire,\u201d Rep. Jared Golden of Maine \u2013 one of about a dozen Democrats in a seat Trump won \u2013 wrote on Musk\u2019s site X. \u201cMusk is stepping on the president\u2019s toes \u2014 making decisions without his approval, pursuing his own agenda. If I had an employee that sidelined me the way Musk is sidelining Trump, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d just sit back and take it.\u201d\n     \n            Pat Dennis, the president of the American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC focused on \u201copposition research\u201d into Republicans, said that while Trump is still the prime motivator, Musk seemed poised to cause damage to the administration.\n     \n            \u201cMusk is acting like you essentially gave Paul Ryan a whole bunch of stimulants and then set him loose in the government,\u201d said Dennis, referring to the former House speaker and deficit hawk. \u201cThis is a level of cost-cutting with no regard for the impact on everyday people, that Trump allegedly set himself in opposition to.\u201d\n     \n            An advisor to multiple Democratic donors told CNN that Democrats should continue to focus on Musk.\n     \n            \u201cWe need to be going to places and say, \u2018Elon Musk now has your Social Security number,\u2019\u201d the advisor said.\n     \n            They acknowledged, however, that Democratic elected officials are still absorbing the rapidly unfolding moves of the new Trump administration. While Democrats envisioned a range of scenarios for the first 100 days of the Trump administration, \u201cElon Musk taking over the government payment systems was not on the bingo card,\u201d the person said.\n     \n            \u201cIt has only been two weeks, and it\u2019s worse than we thought,\u201d they added.\n     \n            Organized labor is attempting to zero in on Musk\u2019s work as well. The AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s major federation of unions, on Wednesday launched a new campaign billed as \u201cThe Department of People Who Work for a Living\u201d to push back on DOGE\u2019s work.\n     \n            \u201cIf Elon Musk can make up his own government department, so can workers,\u201d Liz Shuler, the president of AFL-CIO, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThis is just unprecedented. We\u2019ve never seen this kind of influence by billionaire CEOs on the norms of our government.\u201d\n     \n            The campaign, which is expected to include digital ads and mailers, will aim to hold Musk \u201caccountable,\u201d Shuler said, and amplify the stories of workers who may be impacted by DOGE\u2019s efforts \u2013 from air traffic controllers that play a key role in the flying public\u2019s safety to mine workers dependent on worker safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n     \n            \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is put a human face right on the fact that these are not just bureaucracies. These are not sleepy, tired, old, outdated, outmoded agencies. These are real people,\u201d Shuler said.\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services to the full chamber.\u00a0 The committee voted 14 to 13 to advance Kennedy in a party-line vote around 10:30 a.m. ET. Moderna's stock closed about 6% lower and shares of BioNTech dropped nearly 2%. Pfizer's stock closed more than 1% lower, even after the company reported fourth-quarter results that topped expectations.\u00a0Their shares initially fell by larger margins following the Senate committee vote, then regained some ground. Kennedy, 71, is a notorious vaccine skeptic, making false claims that they are linked to autism despite decades of studies that debunk that association. But Kennedy, during Senate confirmation hearings last week, contended that he is not \"anti-vaccine.\"\u00a0 Kennedy is also the founder of the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, the most well-funded anti-vaccine organization in the U.S. In a government ethics agreement last month, he said he stopped serving as chairman or chief legal counsel for the organization as of December. If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy would oversee federal health agencies that regulate vaccines and other drugs. Some health policy experts have raised concerns about Kennedy using his new potential platform to spread anti-vaccine rhetoric and deter Americans from receiving recommended shots at a time when vaccination rates are already falling, especially among children. During an industry conference in January, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Kennedy's anti-vaccine rhetoric is in \"complete contradiction\" with what the company, regulators and the medical and scientific community believe.

He said it's wise to refrain from sudden moves next week as there won't be enough time to digest such a large amount of information. \"When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands,\" he said. \"Because there's just too much data for any individual to process,\" Palantir is set to report Monday after close, and Cramer pointed out that the data company has been especially favored by the Pentagon as it helps companies and the government use resources more efficiently. He suggested it's likely the stock continues to climb, noting that some investors are fond of CEO Alex Karp. Tuesday is packed with earnings reports. Cramer expects PayPal and Spotify to have great quarters. He noted that Spotify has a successful subscription model that usually helps top Wall Street estimates. Drug giants Merck and Pfizer will also release their numbers. Merck's could be good, he said, and if Pfizer can report positive news about its cancer dugs, that stock could run. PepsiCo and Chipotle also report on Tuesday. According to Cramer, the packaged food stocks have had a tough time since GLP-1 weight loss drugs became popular, especially PepsiCo, known for its soft drinks and snacks. He called the Mexican fast food chain a great growth stock in the restaurant sector and suggested now could be a chance to invest before shares move higher.  Plus, Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices have earnings are on deck Tuesday. Cramer said the Google parent's stock could rise if it reports solid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. He also wondered what AMD will have to say in the wake of breakthrough news from China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, which could make AMD's chips are more desirable. On Wednesday are reports from Walt Disney, Novo Nordisk and Ford. Disney could be a buy before earnings, Cramer said, even as the fires in Los Angeles likely hurt the quarter. He said he'll be waiting to see how Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs are doing, and that Ford stock has been disappointing lately. Thursday brings results from more drug stocks, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb, as well as Amazon. Cramer said he needs more details from Eli Lilly that suggest next year will be successful, and he's optimistic about Bristol Myers's new schizophrenia drug. Cramer added that he's expecting positive earnings from Amazon, but investors might want to wait until after it reports to buy the stock. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the nonfarm payroll report, an inflation metric that's important to the Federal Reserve. If the data suggests strong growth in employment and wages, it may be unlikely the central bank will cut rates in the first half of the year, Cramer said.

Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\u00a0 Shares of Pfizer were down slightly on Tuesday. The results cap off a critical year for Pfizer, which has been pursuing broad cost reductions as it recovers from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the last two years. The company said it is on track to deliver overall net cost savings of roughly $4.5 billion by the end of 2025 from its cost-cutting program.\u00a0 Pfizer believes \"our revenue volatility is largely in the past as Covid-related uncertainties have diminished,\" the company's CFO Dave Denton said on an earnings call on Tuesday. \"Additionally, our cost improvement programs have set the stage for ongoing margin expansion.\" The company booked fourth-quarter net income of $410 million, or 7 cents per share. That compares with a net loss of $3.37 billion, or a loss of 60 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.\u00a0 Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 63 cents for the quarter. Pfizer reported revenue of $17.76 billion for the fourth quarter, up 22% from the same period a year ago. The fourth-quarter results are \"unlikely to shock many investors, but we view another top- and bottom-line beat as positive for improving sentiment,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a research note on Tuesday. The company reiterated the full-year 2025 outlook it provided in December, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, with a similar performance from its Covid products as seen in 2024. Denton noted that changes to the Medicare program resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act will hurt sales by $1 billion, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% compared to 2024. Stripping out one-time items, the company expects 2025 earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 a share.\u00a0 But Wall Street is likely more concerned with Pfizer's long-term financial health and its drug pipeline. Investors are also watching to see whether Pfizer can win a slice of the booming weight loss drug market with the once-daily version of its experimental obesity pill, danuglipron.\u00a0 Pfizer appears to have dodged a proxy battle with activist investor Starboard Value, which has a roughly $1 billion stake in the pharmaceutical giant, for now. The deadline passed for nominating board members for this year. Pfizer's fourth-quarter beat was fueled in part by higher-than-expected demand for its Covid products. Paxlovid, its antiviral pill, brought in $727 million in sales for the quarter, up from the loss of $3.1 billion in revenue recorded in the year-earlier period. But the same quarter last year included a revenue reversal tied to the planned return of around 6.5 million Paxlovid doses from the U.S. government.\u00a0 Pfizer said the growth was driven by strong demand, particularly in the U.S. during a recent Covid wave, and a one-time contract delivery of 1 million treatment courses of Paxlovid to the federal government. Analysts expected the drug to bring in $630.7 million in sales, according to StreetAccount.\u00a0 The company's Covid shot booked $3.4 billion in revenue, down $2 billion from the same period a year ago. Pfizer said the decline was mainly driven by fewer Covid vaccinations globally and lower contracted doses of its shot.\u00a0 Analysts expected $3 billion in sales for the shot, according to StreetAccount. Excluding Covid products, Pfizer said revenue for the fourth quarter rose 12% on an operational basis, fueled by approved cancer products from Seagen, which it acquired in 2023 for a whopping $43 billion. Those drugs brought in $915 million in revenue for the quarter, compared with just $132 million in sales in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue also got a boost from sales of Pfizer's Vyndaqel drugs, which are used to treat a certain type of cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle. Those drugs booked $1.55 billion in sales, up 61% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Analysts had expected that group of drugs to take in $1.51 billion for the quarter, according to estimates from StreetAccount.\u00a0\u00a0 Pfizer said its blood thinner Eliquis, which is co-marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb, also helped drive revenue growth during the period. The drug posted $1.83 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 14% from the year-earlier period.\u00a0 That is slightly higher than the $1.67 billion that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount.\u00a0 Sales of Eliquis could take a hit in 2026, however, when a new price for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price negotiations are a key provision of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act that the pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposes. Pfizer's vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, saw $198 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, down 62% from the year-earlier period. The shot, known as Abrysvo, entered the market during the third quarter of 2023 for seniors and expectant mothers who can pass on protection to their fetuses. The company said the decline came after a significant decrease in U.S. vaccination rates among older adults due to current recommendations from advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which narrowed the market opportunity for RSV shots. The advisory panel in June voted to recommend RSV shots to adults 75 and above, but said those 60 to 74 should do so only if they are at higher risk for severe disease. Analysts had expected the shot to generate sales of $459.5 million, according to StreetAccount estimates. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

It first announced those cuts in April, and expanded on them with Thursday's announcement. The company is preparing to offset the loss in revenue from top-selling treatments slated to lose exclusivity on the market, including its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.\u00a0 Also on Thursday, Bristol Myers Squibb issued full-year 2025 guidance that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, as some of the company's older drugs face competition from cheaper generics. That includes four drugs for different cancers: Revlimid, Pomalyst, Sprycel and Abraxane.\u00a0 Bristol Myers expects revenue to come in around $45.5 billion, which is below the $47.36 billion that analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting.\u00a0 The company's revenue guidance also reflects an approximately $500 million expected negative impact from foreign exchange. The drugmaker expects adjusted earnings per share of between $6.55 and $6.85. Analysts surveyed by LSEG expected adjusted earnings of $6.92 per share.\u00a0 Despite that outlook, Bristol Myers reported fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that blew past expectations, boosted by Eliquis and the company's so-called growth portfolio of drugs.\u00a0 Here is what Bristol Myers reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\u00a0 Bristol Myers posted net income of $72 million, or 4 cents per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $1.8 billion, or 87 cents per share, for the year-earlier period.\u00a0 Excluding certain items, it reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 for the quarter.\u00a0 The pharmaceutical giant's revenue rose 8% from the same period a year ago to $12.34 billion.\u00a0 Eliquis booked $3.2 billion in sales for the quarter, up 11% from the year-ago period. That is above the $3.03 billion that analysts were expecting, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. The blood thinner, which Bristol Myers shares with Pfizer, is expected to lose market exclusivity by 2028.\u00a0 Sales of Eliquis could also take a hit in 2026, when a new negotiated price for the drug goes into effect for certain Medicare patients following negotiations with the federal government. Those price talks are a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act. The second round of negotiations targets 15 additional drugs and will set new prices that will go into effect in 2028. That includes Pomalyst,\u00a0which is used to treat a blood cancer called multiple myeloma and a cancer that develops in people with HIV. Pomalyst brought in $823 million for the period, down 8% from the year-earlier period. Sprycel booked $198 million in sales for the quarter, falling 62% from the same period a year ago. Abraxane generated $174 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, down 30% from the same quarter in 2023.\u00a0 Revlimid took in $1.34 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, down 8% from the same period a year ago. That surpassed analysts' revenue expectations of $1.10 billion for the treatment, according to StreetAccount.\u00a0 Revenue from the company's Growth Portfolio was $6.36 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21% from the year-earlier period.\u00a0 Opdivo brought in $2.48 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, rising 4% from the year-earlier period. That fell under analysts' estimate of $2.51 billion for the quarter, StreetAccount said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Now Hoffman is diving into the health care, which he describes as \"wondrous and terrifying,\" with his latest startup, Manas AI.\u00a0 Hoffman and Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, an oncologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, unveiled the company on Monday. Manas will use artificial intelligence to try and accelerate the drug discovery process, starting with new treatments for aggressive cancers like prostate cancer, lymphoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\u00a0 Developing new drugs is traditionally a costly and complex process. It can take more than 10 years and cost billions of dollars to develop a single medication, according to a report from Deloitte. Manas said it will use its proprietary chemical libraries and AI-powered filters to identify drug candidates more quickly, ideally reducing the decades-long discovery process to just a few years. \"Most people have had friends, family members, etc., who've died from cancer or had serious cancer problems,\" Hoffman told CNBC in an interview this week. \"If we can make a huge difference on this, and this is the kind of thing that AI can make a huge difference in, it's the kind of reason why AI can be great for humanity.\" Manas raised $24.6 million in seed funding, led by General Catalyst and Hoffman with participation from Greylock, where he is a partner. Hoffman has been deep in AI in recent years. He was an early investor in OpenAI, when the project was still a nonprofit, and he helped start Inflection AI along with DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. Last year, Suleyman joined Microsoft, where Hoffman is a board member, as CEO of a new unit called Microsoft AI. Several Inflection employees joined him. Manas has also inked a partnership with Microsoft, and will leverage its Azure cloud-computing platform. Hoffman, who sold LinkedIn to Microsoft for $27 billion, said Manas is deploying several additional tools from Microsoft as well, including some that are not generally available to the public yet.\u00a0 Hoffman has been working with Mukherjee to create Manas for about a year, though the process picked up steam in the last couple months. Hoffman said the team felt ready to publicly share its ambitions this week since its baseline, foundational resources are in order.\u00a0 The company has a long road ahead, and the drug discovery market is very competitive. Other startups along with major pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Merck, are also exploring how to leverage AI to accelerate drug research and development. \u00a0 Hoffman said he feels confident in Manas's approach, though he would be \"totally delighted\" to see multiple companies flourish.\u00a0 \"We also bring the thing that a startup usually brings, which is a willingness to go very hard, abandon things quickly that aren't working,\" he said. \"Live like this week matters, and the result of this week matters.\"\u00a0 Following Manas's launch on Monday, five different potential strategic partners have already approached the company, Hoffman said.\u00a0\u00a0 Hoffman said the company is in \"build quickly\" and \"learn and deploy\" mode. One of its early initiatives is called Project Cosmos, which is an effort to map out the fundamental rules of drug binding, according to the company's website. Hoffman declined to share any additional details about the project.\u00a0 Manas currently has just four employees \u2013 including Hoffman and Mukherjee \u2013 but Hoffman said it will grow. He's been acting as the company's \"AI guy\" while Mukherjee serves as the \"bio guy,\" he said. Ultimately, Manas is about melding the two fields.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It isn't just the best of science and it isn't just the best of AI, because either of those two are insufficient,\" Hoffman said. \"You need to put those two together.\" As the AI guy, Hoffman was paying close attention this week to the sudden emergence of China's DeepSeek in the U.S. DeepSeek began generating buzz in January, when the startup released its open-source reasoning model R1, which rivals OpenAI's o1. The model was reportedly developed at a fraction of the cost of rival models by OpenAI, Anthropic,\u00a0Google\u00a0and others. Hoffman said that while DeepSeek might encourage American companies to pick up the pace and share their plans sooner, the new revelations don't suggest that large models are a bad investment. \"The competition game is on,\" he said, \"But I don't think it's the 'Oh my God, we're losing!' as American technology.\" WATCH: LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman on DeepSeek Got a confidential news tip?

The first shot in the trade war followed a strong but choppy start to 2025 for markets. The S&P 500 climbed 2.7% in January, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.6% and 4.7% for the month, respectively. Investors will have other critical factors to weigh this week along with the tariffs. A huge share of the S&P 500 will report earnings this week, and the January U.S. jobs report will come out Friday. Follow live market updates. Trump slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% duties on imports from China. He put a 10% levy on Canadian oil. Trump said he imposed the tariffs to push the countries to curb the number of migrants coming into the U.S. and stop the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2013 though the president has long backed import controls as a purely economic tool. Canada quickly retaliated with 25% tariffs on $155 billion in U.S. goods, including beer, Kentucky bourbon and orange juice. Mexico said it also would respond in kind, and China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization. The trade war could widen: Trump also threatened tariffs on the European Union and United Kingdom. The tariffs threaten to raise operating costs for a range of U.S. companies that operate in the integrated North American supply chain, and increase prices for consumers if businesses choose to pass on those costs. The potential goods affected touch many parts of everyday life: cars, gasoline, furniture, shoes, toys, beer, avocados and french fries, among others. The stock reactions to Trump's move reflect some of the companies most vulnerable, as shares of General Motors, Ford, Chipotle and Modelo and Corona seller Constellation Brands dropped in premarket trading Monday. Even in a trade war, it's a big week for earnings. More than one-fifth of the S&P 500 is set to post results. Companies reporting include Amazon, Alphabet, Eli Lilly and Ford. Wall Street could also hear more from key executives about how they expect tariffs and the rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek to affect their businesses. Here are the key companies reporting this week: More retirement age Americans are still working. The number of employed people 65 and older in the U.S. jumped more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The group accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024, an increase from 5.7% a decade ago. An aging population, a labor shortage driven by the Covid pandemic and a shift toward 401(k) accounts instead of pensions, among other factors, has helped to drive the increase. \u2013 CNBC's Sean Conlon, Pia Singh, Tanaya Macheel, Katrina Bishop, Holly Ellyatt, Gregory Iacurci and Alex Harring contributed to this report.

The prevalence of remote work ballooned during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many experienced telework perhaps for the first time in their careers; employees cite work-life balance as by far the biggest perceived benefit, according to Pew Research Center. Some researchers have quantified the financial value workers assign to telework. For example, about 40% of workers say they'd accept a pay cut of at least 5% to keep their remote job, according to a recent study by researchers at Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. About 9% would trade at least 20% of their salaries to preserve telework, said researchers, who polled more than 2,000 workers. Put another way, workers see the ability to work from home \u2014 even two or three days a week \u2014 as equivalent to getting a raise, according to Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies workplace management practices. Data that Bloom has collected in recent years suggests the average worker equates remote work to about an 8% raise, he said. \"That figure seems remarkably stable\" over time, Bloom said in an e-mail. \"For some subsets of workers you can find higher numbers,\" relative to the pay cut they would accept, Bloom said. For example, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published in January that looked at workers predominantly in the technology field found they'd accept an average 25% pay cut for a job that offers fully or partially remote work. \"The reality is: It is a very attractive feature of a job,\" said Zoe Cullen, an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, who co-authored the NBER research. \u00a0 The paper examined data on almost 1,400 workers from the U.S. tech sector. The average person was 32 years old, and had about seven years of work experience. Researchers gathered data on the job offers individuals receive and the jobs they ultimately choose, with the average gig offering $239,000 a year in total compensation. More from Personal Finance:What the 'mother of all trade wars' can teach about tariffsL.A. wildfire victims face financial anxiety amid recoveryHow to check the status of your federal tax refund Of course, not all Americans prefer out-of-office work. About 41% of workers with the ability to telework \u2014 but who rarely do \u2014 say in-office work helps them feel more connected to co-workers, and 30% think in-person work helps with mentoring opportunities, according to Pew Research Center. Working from home has also waned from its pandemic-era peak. Big companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell Technologies, JPMorgan Chase, UPS and The Washington Post have initiated return-to-office mandates for at least some employees. President Donald Trump also issued an order Jan. 20 to terminate remote work for federal employees and require full-time in-office attendance, with some exceptions. That said, on a national scale, employers don't seem to be retrenching en masse, according to labor economists. The number of paid days worked from home during the workweek has held steady for the past two years, at between 25% and 30% \u2014 more than triple the pre-Covid rate, according to WFH Research. Employees aren't the only ones who get a benefit: Remote work is also a profitable arrangement for businesses, according to labor economists. For example, employers may save money on real estate by downsizing office space. They may also hire job candidates from across the country, potentially at a lower relative salary, depending on geography. Workers with the ability to work from home also tend to quit less frequently, thereby reducing company spending on expensive functions like hiring, recruitment and training, Bloom said.

House Republicans recently floated a list of potential measures to help compensate for lost revenue from trillions of dollars in tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump. Taxing employees for fringe benefits such as employer-provided transportation, free food and on-site gyms is up for discussion. Currently, employer-provided transportation benefits, like transit passes and parking, up to $315 per month, are excluded from taxable income. Employer-provided meals and lodging are also generally excluded from taxable income if they are for the employer's convenience, and employer-provided on-site gym facilities for employees and their families are excluded from taxable income. Taxing employees for these perks could save around $157 billion over 10 years, according to Republican estimates.\u00a0 To be sure, these proposals are still in the early stages and there's a lot of jockeying by lawmakers to accommodate Trump's $4 trillion extension of the 2017 tax cuts as well as make good on campaign promises for tax breaks on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits \u2014 in all, the tax cut promises made on the campaign trail by Trump could take the total to near $10 trillion. The situation is especially tenuous given the hefty $36 trillion federal deficit. \"I don't think it's going to be popular with employees, which potentially makes it hard to enact,\" said Dustin Stamper, tax legislative affairs practice leader at Grant Thornton's Washington National Tax Office. \"There are some real political downsides to some of these [proposals].\" Taxing employees for fringe benefits such as free access to on-site facilities like gyms and certain employer-provided meals and lodging has been debated before, but it \"has never made it very far,\" said Thomas Godwin, a professor at Cornell University's SC Johnson College of Business. \"It's something that, for Congress, your constituents really feel, even if it's just a little bit,\" he said. This time around, however, it's anybody's guess how the situation will play out, given the magnitude of revenue needed to balance the cost of tax cuts. Here's what workers might expect if these provisions are enacted: Employees would likely have to pay the tax If enacted, workers would likely have to pay income tax on the fair market value of the fringe benefits they are getting from their employer, said Jeff Martin, tax principal at Grant Thornton's Washington National Tax Office. This would make these benefits less valuable to employees when taxes are factored in. Companies would wind up with many \"potentially angry employees if they have to pay taxes on pretend income on the couple of StairMasters in the basement of their building,\" Stamper said. Employers would face hard decisions about covering costs Some companies might decide to cover the additional tax burden for employees in part or in full, but this could be an expensive undertaking, Godwin said. Some companies might stop offering certain or all affected fringe benefits altogether. \"Administering this would be very difficult if they were to go forward with it,\" Martin said. Dropping benefits that workers have grown accustomed to, however, can cause other problems for employers. Worker morale and productivity could take a hit Messing around with benefits employees have enjoyed for many years can be a recipe for disaster when it comes to morale and worker productivity. \"If you start charging employees for parking when they've had free parking forever, that's going to be a lot of unhappy employees,\" Martin said. This could be especially impactful in urban areas where parking isn't typically free. \"If all of a sudden you're being charged $250 a month for parking, that's a huge difference,\" he added. These issues are especially tricky given that many companies are pushing workers to come into the office more often, Godwin said. Although many companies continue to operate on a hybrid basis, there's a growing expectation that workers will be in the office for more days. Some companies, including Amazon, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are requiring workers to return to the office five days a week. \"The RTO culture is starting to percolate and this is going to make it that much harder for employees to want to come back to the office,\" Godwin said. Companies may pivot to other types of perks that aren't taxable In addition to the potential impact on RTO initiatives, companies would have to consider the utilization of the benefits in question, costs, administrative burdens and the extent to which employees value those benefits, said John Jurik, national practice leader of retirement plan consulting at Gallagher, a provider of insurance, risk management and consulting services. Some companies might decide to drop certain benefits and pivot to other types of offerings that might make a more meaningful impact on an employee's financial well-being such as financial education, coaching and planning, Jurik said.\u00a0 Competition could be a factor Employer approaches may differ based on employee demand, location, demographics and other factors. \"They have to evaluate their population and what's important to them,\" Jurik said.\u00a0 Competition for talent will also factor in, said Norman Richter,\u00a0adjunct lecturer at Babson College, who teaches classes on tax policy. Companies may continue to offer the perks, either at the employee's expense or on their own dime, depending on how their competitors approach these issues, he said.\u00a0 Some unpopular tax measures will have to get done To pay for tax cuts, lawmakers have to find ways to raise \"big dollars,\" said Chester Spatt, professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. He's doubtful Congress will decide to tax employees' fringe benefits because the expected savings is not that big compared to other potential options that are easier to implement. \"There's a reason they haven't been taxed before,\" he said. Still, the money to fund expensive tax cuts has to come from somewhere. \"You have to find ways to offset that if you're going to keep all your Republican members of Congress on board,\" Richter said. Tariffs may not deliver the necessary savings, so other options, even unpopular ones, may remain on the table, he added. \"They may be forced to be more aggressive than politically comfortable in order to keep all the votes together that they need. Unpopular stuff is going to have to get done.\"  Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

As the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, many prominent companies have publicly scaled back or scrapped their programs and goals for metrics such as employee and leadership representation. Others have insisted they will continue to support DEI, opening themselves up to political pressure \u2014 but also financial opportunity. DEI professionals told CNBC that either strategy comes with tricky pros and cons: Brands seen as advocating for DEI could face legal challenges, but they also stand to benefit from the advantages of DEI and the loyalty of customers who share their values. Brands that publicly pull back may avoid the scrutiny of President Donald Trump and his allies, but risk stirring up controversy in an increasingly polarized environment. Some companies, fearful of moving too loudly in either direction, may continue to support DEI internally, experts said, even as they stay silent publicly in order to avoid activist campaigns against them. \"I can't be clear enough: DEI isn't dying. It's evolving,\" said Daisy Auger-Dom\u00ednguez, founder and CEO of workplace consulting firm Auger-Dom\u00ednguez Ventures. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office ending all DEI programs across the federal government. He issued another order a day later demanding the Justice Department identify and potentially sue \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners.\" The White House's hostility toward DEI has elevated the stakes for corporations already grappling with how to navigate the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion amid a growing culture war, experts said. Several companies, such as Lowe's and Ford, had begun rolling back DEI programs even before Trump's election victory in November. In a statement to CNBC, Ford said it was committed to a \"respectful and inclusive workplace for all employees.\" On Nov. 25, Walmart said it was winding down some DEI-related efforts, though in a statement to CNBC this week, the retailer said it is focused on its values of \"respect, integrity, service and excellence.\" In late January, Target issued an internal memo ending several DEI-related goals and partnerships and emphasizing a program centered on \"belonging.\" On Wednesday, Google said it will retire its aspirational hiring targets in light of the executive orders and recent court decisions. A Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement this week it's \"committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities.\" Others, including Caterpillar and 3M, told CNBC they are currently reviewing the executive orders to assess their implications. Citigroup is also analyzing the impact of the orders, a person familiar with the process told CNBC on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal matters. \"What you're seeing right now is people trying to safeguard internally the work that is necessary, because they understand not just the business but the people value of this work,\" Auger-Dom\u00ednguez told CNBC. \"This is not the time to be experimenting with this. This is the time to be doubling down on what's important to your organization,\" she added. Some companies have stood firm on their support for DEI since the executive order. Costco is perhaps the most prominent example: Its board of directors unanimously opposed a proposal by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, for the wholesaler to publish a report on the risks of its DEI policies. Investors defeated the proposal with about 98% voting against it, the company announced at its annual shareholder meeting Jan. 23. \"A welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\" Costco Chairman Hamilton James said at the meeting. Apple is similarly resisting the think tank's proposal for the tech giant to consider abolishing its diversity and inclusion initiatives. The measure will receive a vote at Apple's annual shareholder meeting Feb. 25. \"We strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" Apple's board said in a statement. Several high-profile CEOs including Bill Ready of Pinterest, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs have recently indicated that their businesses will stick with their current approaches to DEI. Both JPMorgan and Goldman are also targets of anti-DEI proposals by the National Center for Public Policy Research. JPMorgan directed a CNBC request for comment to Dimon's 2024 shareholder letter, where he wrote that the company's DEI initiatives \"lead to more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results for us and for the economy overall.\" Goldman Sachs declined to comment to CNBC. Ice cream company Ben & Jerry's, which has long been vocal about social activism, said in a statement to CNBC that it remains committed to supporting equity and justice throughout the company, while also calling out companies that have rolled back DEI commitments made in the wake of George Floyd's murder by police in 2020. \"We believe that companies that timidly bow to the current political climate by attempting to turn back the clock will become increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace and will ultimately be judged as having been on the wrong side of history,\" the company said. Outdoor apparel company Patagonia, which likewise has a history of activism for climate action, also said in a statement to CNBC that it wouldn't be rolling back its DEI policies. \"We stand firm in support of our justice, equity and antiracism policies and practices,\" Patagonia said. Although cosmetics brand E.l.f. Beauty does not have formal DEI programs, it promotes inclusivity in its company culture and has not changed its stance on DEI, CEO Tarang Amin said in written comments to CNBC. \"This isn't about risks or rewards, it's about having a diverse set of views to best serve our community with exceptional products they want, at prices they can afford,\" Amin wrote. Andrew Clarke, CEO of clothing retailer Francesca's, posted a LinkedIn video last week affirming the company's commitment to respect and inclusion. He told CNBC that he sees DEI as having been key to Francesca's rebound after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. \"D&I is not an abbreviation or a mandated deliberate strategy in this organization, it's a human strategy,\" Clarke said. \"The notion of inclusivity, respect and belonging and treating our fellow associates as we would like to be treated ourselves \u2014 that has been awesome for the culture, but also for the turnaround of our business from a financial perspective.\" Clarke cited a senior leadership team composed of 69% women and employee policies such as a flexible dress code as examples of how Francesca's centers inclusivity. Although he said he is mindful of potential legal limitations from recent White House policy, he said the company will continue the strategies that have made it successful. Even if brands are staying silent or rolling back their external goals or messaging, DEI experts told CNBC, they may still be working to promote diversity and inclusion within their companies. Amira Barger, a DEI executive and professor of communications at California State University, East Bay, said businesses' approaches to DEI might look more like they did before 2020, when many companies were quick to issue public statements and launch programs in support of DEI and social justice in the wake of Floyd's murder and the national demonstrations it sparked. DEI programs boost talent retention and consumer loyalty, Barger said, adding she doesn't expect corporations to end them entirely. Researchers have identified relationships between corporate DEI and benefits such as adaptability and financial outperformance. \"I do think we will continue to see companies be less\u00a0vocal, but I think people should take a pause and really ask more questions, because I do think many of these companies are still quietly doing the work behind the scenes,\" Barger said. Some companies have been rebranding and renaming their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Eloiza Domingo, CEO and founder of consulting firm FourTen and former chief DEI officer and vice president for human resources at Allstate, said she's seen an increase in the use of terms such as \"belonging,\" \"cultural competency\" and \"employee engagement\" in place of the typical acronym DEI. As someone who's worked with companies on DEI, Domingo said, she's empathetic toward those companies that are reconsidering their external DEI strategy. She said she's grappling with that issue for her own business, as she works on attracting more clients. \"I'm known as a diversity keynote. I'm known as a changemaker. Now, that is under not only scrutiny but under attack,\" Domingo said. \"And so what do I do as an entrepreneur to keep my business going, but also to feed the kids? That's really, really scary.\" In a Jan. 6 statement titled \"Our Commitment to Inclusion,\" McDonald's announced it was retiring \"aspirational representation goals,\" participation in external DEI surveys, and its supply chain DEI pledge. It also changed its diversity team's name to \"Global Inclusion Team.\" The fast food giant faced immediate backlash, leading to McDonald's Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer Desiree Ralls-Morrison defending the company in a LinkedIn post. Ralls-Morrison asserted that many critics hadn't fully read the statement, which also said that McDonald's had met its targets in areas such as gender pay equity and supplier diversity and that the company was \"proud of our incredible accomplishments in this space and excited to continue our inclusion journey.\" \"McDonald's\u00a0was suggested in the headlines as having killed DEI,\" Barger said. \"It is much more nuanced. I think they strategically rebranded their approach.\" Ralls-Morrison and McDonald's didn't respond to requests for comment. Sina Port, a brand strategist and diversity consultant, said businesses that aren't publicizing their DEI policies can still communicate their support for inclusion to consumers \u2014 without being overly performative or making empty commitments. She cited actions such as promoting the personal brands of diverse employees and creating products that are actually useful to communities, such as sports equipment for people with disabilities. \"In general, I'm not a huge fan of just making announcements to customers. I look more at the action that you're taking,\" Port told CNBC. It's too soon to determine whether companies currently taking stances on DEI will see an impact on their stock or revenue, Barger said, but she expects some consumers will make buying decisions based on the company's values. \"In these moments we're going to be tested in terms of consumer loyalty, every brand,\" Barger said. Activist campaigns targeting specific corporations have had a demonstrable impact in recent years. Backlash against Bud Light's partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023 contributed to a sales slump for the brand that resulted in Bud Light losing its long-held status as the top-selling U.S. beer. Target said a boycott of the retailer over its Pride merchandise that same year hurt its sales. The company had offered Pride merchandise for years prior to the boycott. DEI supporters are hoping to leverage the same influence for their cause. Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, has organized two \"buy-cotts\" at Costco, in which the organization mobilized people to shop at the wholesaler to support its pro-DEI stance. The two events collectively brought in more than 400 shoppers, he told CNBC. Sharpton said NAN is planning more shows of support at Costco and other businesses. The organization is also actively researching companies to boycott for their DEI policy rollbacks, Sharpton said, adding that NAN is specifically looking at corporations that have small profit margins and a significant Black consumer base. The group also plans to buy stock in these companies and submit shareholder proposals. \"We'll support those that support us.\u2029We believe that corporations have the right to decide their policy, but we have the right to decide who we're going to patronize,\" Sharpton said. \u2014 CNBC's Melissa Repko and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

Trump on Saturday signed executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Trump on Monday agreed to pause tariffs on Mexico for one month, while the import taxes remain in place for China and Canada. An overlooked provision in the orders eliminates the \"de minimis\" trade loophole relied on heavily by Chinese online retailers like PDD's Temu and Shein. The de minimis exemption allows packages worth less than $800 to be shipped into the U.S. duty free. It's been a critical tool for Temu and Shein as they look to grow their presence in the U.S. by offering rock-bottom prices on everything from clothes and furniture to electronics and home decor. Lawmakers have zeroed in on de minimis in recent years, arguing it gives Chinese companies an unfair advantage by allowing them to bypass tariffs. Officials have also said de minimis packages are \"subject to minimal documentation and inspection,\" raising product safety concerns. Trade organizations and advocacy groups have also pushed Trump to curb de minimis shipments because they argue that it has allowed shipments of fentanyl to enter the U.S. Without that tax advantage, it's unclear if Temu, Shein and other Chinese e-commerce platforms will be able to keep prices low and sustain the explosive growth they've seen in the U.S. in recent years. Temu and Shein have previously said their business models don't rely on de minimis. Shein and Temu have opened distribution centers in the U.S., allowing sellers in China to ship goods to the U.S. and store them in local warehouses. It's more in line with Amazon's logistics network, which spans hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. That may not be enough to soften the blow of the removal of de minimis. In a note to clients on Sunday, analysts at Citi estimated Temu's local warehouse program remains a small portion of its overall business. \"Although Temu's efforts in ramping up its local warehouse/semi-managed model over the past year could help mitigate some of the tariff risks, we estimate the [gross merchandise volume] from local warehouses might have contributed 20%+ to U.S. GMV by end-2024,\" the analysts wrote. They added, \"We believe the new tariffs will still have a negative read-through to Temu's growth in 2025 and beyond.\" The end of de minimis could also dampen Temu and Shein's digital ad spending, as they look to \"offset concerns on rising product costs,\" Bank of America analysts wrote Monday in a note to clients. Shein and Temu have been significant contributors to Meta's advertising revenue in recent quarters. The companies have gone on a digital marketing blitz in an attempt to reach more American consumers. \"Meta's 10-K indicates that revenue from China-based advertisers represented 11% of Family of Apps revenue (vs 6% in 2023), and we estimate Temu and Shein exposure could be 2-4% of ad spend for Google and Meta,\" the Bank of America analysts wrote.

Doximity is a digital platform for medical professionals that can help them carry out telehealth appointments with patients, find referrals, stay current on medical news and more. The company's revenue increased 25% to $168.6 million in its third quarter, up from $135.3 million in the same period last year. For its fiscal fourth quarter, Doximity said it expects to report revenue between $132.5 million and $133.5 million, while analysts were expecting $123.8 million. The company also raised guidance for its full fiscal year and said it expects to report revenue of between $564.6 million and $565.6 million. Doximity's adjusted EBITDA was $102.0 million, up 39% year over year. Analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target on the stock to $71 from $53, and said this was driven by a higher EBITDA as well as accelerating growth and strong margin performance. Doximity reported \"impressive incremental margins,\" the analysts added. \"This was a statement type of quarter, with Doximity exhibiting separation at more than 2X market growth,\" the analysts wrote in a Friday note. Bank of America analysts said Doximity had a \"very strong quarter.\" They said the company's growth rate is benefiting from easy comparables, the launch of its client portal, the ramping of new products and its election spend. The analysts said that while Doximity might have a more moderate revenue growth rate in fiscal 2026, the company appears well-positioned to grow faster than the digital ad market in the long term. They reiterated their neutral rating on the stock, but raised the price target to $75 from $63. \"Doximity is accelerating its share gains versus peers which is due to strong contributions from new products and some tailwinds from its new client portal,\" Bank of America analysts said in the Friday note. Analysts at Leerink Partners upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform and increased the price target to $90 from $60. They said they see the continuation of core growth trends at Doximity. \"In short \u2014 we are done fighting the trend, as we see upside to the baseline and a number of green shoots (new products, AI investments, the aforementioned portal) all contributing to ongoing growth,\" the analysts wrote.

While still challenging, with U.S. joblessness jumping to 10% and a 33% drop in home prices, the 2025 exam has smaller spikes in unemployment and smaller declines in stock and real estate values than previous versions, Jason Goldberg of Barclays said Thursday in a note titled \"2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\" The Fed will soon take steps to \"reduce the volatility of stress test results and begin to improve model transparency\" in the 2025 exam, the regulator said in a statement released Wednesday after the close of regular trading. Shares of Citigroup jumped 2.9% in midday trading, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America each rose at least 1.5%. Big banks gained more than smaller lenders, with the KBW Bank Index rising 1.2% compared with the 0.9% gain of the S&P Regional Banking ETF. The stress test changes bolster the case made by Wall Street analysts that big U.S. banks will face a friendlier regulatory regime under the Trump administration. Since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the biggest U.S. banks have had to undergo annual exams that test their ability to withstand a severe recession while continuing to lend to consumers and businesses. Banks have complained for years that the annual stress tests were opaque and unfairly administered, and industry trade groups sued the Fed in December over the exam. By making the latest iteration of the test both less challenging and more predictable, banks could hold smaller capital cushions later this year, according to Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala. \"The 2025 stress test scenario, broadly better vs last year, increases our confidence that banks should begin to see relief on regulatory capital requirements, given our expectations for a shift to a balanced, transparent, and more predictable regulatory regime,\" Poonawala wrote Thursday in a note. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Apple's decline was steeper than all of the tech megacaps, other than Tesla, and shows how vulnerable the iPhone manufacturer could be to increased import costs. While Apple faced tariffs during the first Trump administration, the company was largely able to avoid fees by securing waivers for its specific products. It also expanded its supply chain to do some assembly in countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia and India. But Apple remains reliant on Chinese production. Apple declined to comment on the tariffs. They go into effect on Tuesday. \"Apple being included in China tariffs is contrary to our expectations,\" wrote Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett in a note on Monday. Crockett wrote that he expects Apple to pass price increases to the consumer, a move that he said could upset Trump. \"We thought history would repeat. But that's not the case right now,\" Rosenblatt wrote. Last week, Apple reported 4% revenue growth in the December quarter to $124 billion. However, the company guided investors to expect merely \"low to mid single digits\" growth in the current quarter, and said sales in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong declined 11% in the latest period. The ultimate effect of the tariffs on Apple's profit may depend on how much U.S. demand the company can fill from production locations outside of China. If Apple can source 80% of U.S.-bound devices from outside of China and doesn't raise prices, it could hurt annual earnings by 5 cents per share, or less than 1%, according to a note on Monday from Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan. If half of U.S. Apple devices are from China, it would hurt Apple's full-year earnings by 12 cents, Mohan estimates. For the fiscal year ending in September, analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $7.34, according to LSEG. \"As the new tariff is imposed on imports from China, Apple could have its manufacturing partners ramp up production in India and ship to the U.S.,\" Mohan wrote. \"This could also be done for other Apple products that are manufactured in countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.\" WATCH: Apple 'built for earnings resiliency' Got a confidential news tip?

On Saturday, Trump slapped 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and a 10% levy on those from China. On Monday, the U.S. agreed to pause tariffs on Mexico for one month in return for President Claudia Sheinbaum sending troops to northern border. Those decisions reversed the stock market's early slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently lower by about 100 points after buckling 600 points as the trading day began. Steel stocks waffled, after seeing some gains in the premarket. Nucor shares were up about 2% and U.S. Steel moved 1% higher in morning trading, while Steel Dynamics was lower. The levies are expected to make foreign steel more expensive in the United States. Companies hope U.S. production will rise as a result, and give them an opportunity to raise prices. The industry has been battling cheap foreign imports for years, thanks to illegal dumping into the U.S. market, Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said in an interview with CNBC's \"Mad Money\" last Tuesday. Dumping refers to when a foreign country exports products at a lower price than in its home market or below production costs. \"It's the illegal dumping, the subsidization of steels and the currency manipulation that creates a very unbalanced and unlevel playing field that has hurt the steel industry for decades,\" Topalian told Jim Cramer. Canada is the top steel exporter into the U.S., while Mexico is the third largest, according to the Census Bureau. The countries were initially targeted in the first Trump administration's tariffs, but eventually reached a trade deal that included an exemption. Morgan Stanley sees a direct impact on the pricing power for U.S. steel companies. \"We believe prices are beginning to recover after a challenging 2024, supported by protectionist trade measures,\" analyst Carlos De Alba wrote in a note Monday. \"We project prices to improve further in 2026 as tariff implications flow through the U.S. economy.\" However, those price increases will be tempered by limited dampened demand. The Wall Street investment bank anticipates \"modest\" steel demand growth of 1.6%. In addition, De Alba downgraded U.S. Steel, saying he no longer sees meaningful upside to his price target, assuming U.S. Steel remains independent and isn't acquired. His target of $39 per share implies 6% upside from Friday's close. The planned acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel was blocked by the Biden administration in January. Nucor is now partnering with Cleveland-Cliffs in a potential bid for U.S. Steel, sources recently told CNBC's David Faber. Meanwhile, UBS also sees higher steel prices if the tariffs are imposed and kept. \"Trade disruption should drive prices higher in the near term and support U.S. steel equities, but low demand and capacity additions will offset these gains in major products in the medium term in our view,\" analyst Andrew Jones wrote in a note Monday. Bank of America Securities also highlighted future headwinds, despite the benefit the steelmakers will see from more expensive imports. \"Longer term, we see downside risk to the US steel stocks from the potential for materially reduced auto production, around 25% of U.S. steel demand,\" analyst Lawson Winder wrote in a note Monday.

The Reserve Bank of India is poised to trim the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% as it concludes its policy meeting on Friday, setting off \"a shallow rate cut cycle,\" said Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Bank. Indian bonds have rallied\u00a0in recent weeks with the 10-year benchmark yield falling by 16.5 basis points in about three weeks to 6.664% as of Wednesday close, according to LSEG data, as traders ramp up wagers for an interest rate cut at the February meeting. If the RBI does lower rates, it will be the first cut in nearly five years. The central bank last reduced rates in May 2020 as the country battled the Covid-19 pandemic-inflicted downturn. Investors will also scrutinize the statement of the new RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra to assess the direction of the bank's monetary policy. Malhotra took charge in December. \"It will be interesting to see if the RBI continues with the governor's statement, apart from the monetary policy statement, as a tool of policy communication,\" Goldman Sachs said. The Wall Street bank anticipates a quarter-percentage cut this week, along with a monetary policy shift to looser \"accommodative\" stance from \"neutral.\" It also penciled in an additional 25-basis-point cut in April. The benchmark repo rate has remained steady at 6.5% for past two years, as the domestic inflation rate has stayed above the central bank's medium-term target of 4%, and even breached the RBI's upper tolerance limit of 6% in October. \"The delay in implementation of universal tariffs by the incoming U.S. administration provides some tactical space for RBI to prioritize domestic growth ... and space to cut policy rates,\" said Ruhul Bajoria, an economist at Bank of America in India. The Indian government has been steadily lowering its full-year real GDP forecasts, after the economic growth\u00a0missed expectations\u00a0by a large margin in the quarter ended September, when its grew by 5.4% \u2014 its slowest expansion in nearly two years. The latest projection last month trimmed the growth estimates for the current fiscal year to 6.4% from 7.2% in October, its worst in four years, while inflation projection was raised to 4.8% versus 4.5% earlier. After breaching the upper limit in October, India's consumer price inflation has eased, dropping within the central bank's tolerance ceiling of 6%,\u00a0coming in\u00a0at 5.22% in December\u00a0and\u00a05.48% in November. Softer inflation readings have offered the RBI room to lower rates, in what is also the first policy meeting after Malhotra took charge for a three-year term. His predecessor, Shaktikanta Das had maintained steady interest rates for nearly two years toward the end of his six-year stint. In RBI's most recent monetary policy meeting in December, the rate-setting panel kept the key interest rate unchanged in a split decision, while cutting the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points to 4.0%, effectively easing the monetary conditions. The new senior monetary policy leadership could give \"the MPC\u00a0a fresh look, but also possibly a different approach,\" Bajoria said. Malhotra has remained fairly tight-lipped on his monetary policy views, but he acknowledged in the financial stability report in December that easing inflation and the potential for monetary policy flexibility were positive developments. The governor also cautioned the medium-term economic outlook remains challenging, citing risks including rising geopolitical conflicts and financial market turmoil. He has reportedly ordered a review of the central bank's inflation and growth forecasting tools in an effort to minimize projection errors. A weakening rupee has made it tougher to loosen the monetary policy. The rupee has been on a steady decline against a stronger dollar, shedding 3.6% against the dollar since early November. With the rupee hitting record lows against the greenback, any cuts to the bank's policy rate could spark a further rise in domestic inflation, putting further pressure on the currency and likely triggering capital outflows. RBI has acted to implement substantial interventions in the foreign exchange market to help cushion a potential sudden outflows of foreign capital and avoid any steep fall in the currency. \"The level of volatility on which intervention is undertaken appears to have shifted higher,\" BofA's Bajoria said, adding that \"a weak rupee can influence timing, but would not overrule the need for policy support.\" India-watchers have also been on\u00a0tenterhooks over possible actions\u00a0by President Donald Trump, who floated the idea of universal tariffs during his campaign trail. With a trade\u00a0surplus of over $43 billion with the U.S in 2023 \u2014 over $41 billion in the first 11 months of 2024 \u2014 India faces heightened scrutiny as Trump focuses on reducing trade deficits. The U.S. trade policy framework under Donald Trump's second presidency could strengthen the dollar and Treasury yields, keeping the U.S. interest rates elevated for longer. That has\u00a0complicated the policy decisions for central banks in Asia,\u00a0including the RBI, as boosting growth by loosening policy would mean widening the rate differentials and reducing the allure of its investment assets. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen keen to enhance trade relations with the Trump administration and avoid tariff tensions with its largest trading partner. Modi has reportedly been invited to meet with Trump next week. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The rule allowed international exporters to ship packages worth less than $800 inspection- and duty-free into the United States.\n     \n            Chinese e-commerce sites have built their gargantuan business models around this exemption. The relaxed restrictions and tax exemptions on cheap products has allowed more than a billion packages to pour in at a low-cost price for consumers looking for a deal on clothing to household goods.\n     \n            But the Trump administration is getting rid of the provision that made these goods so cheap and easy to access.\n     \n            \u201cIf you inspect every package, it\u2019s going to raise costs dramatically for consumers,\u201d Clark Packard, a research fellow at Cato Trade, said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to slow down the reception of goods that were bought.\u201d\n     \n            Currently, US Customs and Border Protection has the authority to open and inspect all international packages, though in practice it doesn\u2019t open every single item.\n     \n            Trump enacted 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Tuesday, adding to a wide array of tariffs that were placed on goods from the country during his first term. (The administration delayed a 25% tariff order on Canada and Mexico until March 1.) Beijing hit back with a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars and pickup trucks.\n     \n            The ramifications of a looming US-China trade war have begun to trickle in for the customers of Temu and Shein, which is headquartered in Singapore. Late on Tuesday, the US Postal Service suspended the acceptance of international parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice \u2014 but this was quickly reversed Wednesday morning when USPS announced it would continue accepting those packages.\n     \n            Although no reason was given for the initial suspension, the Postal Service suggested Wednesday that it was related to the new tariffs and the elimination of the de minimis exemption.\n     \n            The de minimis provision has been around since the 1930s, but the threshold has increased over the years. It\u2019s meant to ease trade and help out consumers, Packard told CNN.\n     \n            The exemption means buyers don\u2019t have to fill out tiresome customs paperwork or pay tariffs on small packages.\n     \nIn September 2024, the Biden administration announced it was cracking down on what it called abuse of the de minimis exemption, saying that over the past decade shipments increased from about 140 million a year to over a billion.\n     \n            The exponential increase made it more challenging to enforce trade laws and also posed challenges for American workers and businesses, upholding US consumer protections laws and combatting the fentanyl trade.\n     \n            The Trump administration said the suspension will stop shipments of fentanyl from Mexico and Canada in small packages.\n     \n            Policymakers already want to appear tough on China, said Rob Handfield, a professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University. The US also has concerns over fast fashion labor practices in China, though the administration has not specified why China is targeted.\n     \n            The de minimis exemption is why these Chinese goods are so cheap for US customers, said Christopher Tang, a professor of global supply chain management at the University of California, Los Angeles. More than 80% of total US e-commerce shipments in 2022 were de minimis imports, according to a congressional research report.\n     \nDuring the first Trump administration, \u201cconsumers bore basically 90 to 100% of the cost of a tariff,\u201d Packard said. \u201cSo, if that similar dynamic exists, consumers could expect a 10% increase if it\u2019s coming from China.\u201d\n     \n            Customs is not equipped to handle this level of change, and it could cause other delays, Handfield said.\n     \n            \u201cThe operations would be horrendous in terms of implementation,\u201d Tang said.\n     \n            Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, also noted that taking away the de minimis carve-out would impact not just Temu and Shein but also Amazon, eBay, Etsy and other retailers that ship from China.\n     \n            In 2024, Temu ran an ad during the Super Bowl (at a range of $6.5 million to $7 million for a 30-second spot) with $14 million in coupons and giveaways. The Boston-based firm \u2014 owned by PDD (PDD), the group behind Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo \u2014 paid for three ads during the game and two after the game.\n     \n            Whether that will happen at this year\u2019s Super Bowl in February is now in question.\n     \n            Cutting the exemption could significantly taper the growth of Chinese e-commerce companies, according to a Bank of America research note. That slowdown could hit their marketing budget.\n     \n            Americans are used to seeing Temu and Shein everywhere. Revenue from China-based advertisers grew from 6% of Meta\u2019s family of apps revenue to 11% in 2024, according to the company\u2019s financial reports. Bank of America estimated Temu and Shein exposure could be 2% to 4% of ad spend for Google and Meta.\n     \n            To get around the exemption\u2019s disappearance, companies can expand their warehouses in the US, Tang said. They can ship bulk amounts through customs and then reship it across the US \u2013 but customers will still have to pay the import tax. The perk: This could create more US jobs, Tang said.\n     \n            The companies could also ship products to other ASEAN countries such as Vietnam and ship it to the US there, but the extra shipping costs would also eventually trickle down to customers.\n     \n            There was more potentially bad news for Temu and Shein out of Europe Wednesday. The European Union said it would control imports of low-value products from such websites more tightly as it unveiled a number of actions to tackle \u201cthe surge of unsafe, counterfeit and otherwise non-compliant or illicit products\u201d entering the bloc.\n     \nCNN\u2019s Eric Cheung, Simone McCarthy, Olesya Dmitracova and Matt Egan contributed to this report. \n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

They, alongside tech industry leaders, have encouraged Trump to remove Chopra from his role \u2014 which was made possible by a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that enabled presidents to fire CFPB directors.\n     \n            Chopra was appointed in 2021 by former President Joe Biden to serve as director of the bureau that regulates financial agencies. The director of the CFPB, who under law was to serve a five-year term, also serves as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voting on key banking regulations. Chopra will no longer be serving in that role either.\n     \n            In his time at the CFPB, Chopra spearheaded controversial regulation limiting overdraft fees banks can charge as well as late fees credit card companies could collect from customers.\n     \n            The rule intending to cap credit card late fees at $8 was later struck down by a federal judge. The CFPB rule on overdraft fees, which would cap them at $5 \u2014 a substantial savings from the $35 that customers are typically charged \u2014 was finalized at the end of last year but is likely to face legal challenges, as well.\n     \n            Under Chopra\u2019s leadership, the CFPB also finalized a rule making personal data more accessible so that it is easier to switch banks. Before Trump took office this month, the agency finalized a rule that would remove about $49 billion in medical bills from credit reports.\n     \n            \u201cPeople who get sick shouldn\u2019t have their financial future upended,\u201d said Chopra in a statement on January 7.\n     \n            The consumer watchdog agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis by way of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The agency was the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who began advocating for it in 2007 when she was a Harvard Law School professor.\n     \n            Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, applauded Chopra for \u201cholding Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families,\u201d she said Saturday in a statement.\n     \n            Despite their differences with Trump, Warren and several progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, have signaled their support for the president\u2019s campaign promise to temporarily cap credit interest rates at 10% \u2014 less than half of current rates according to Federal Reserve data.\n     \n            To fulfill this promise, Warren said Trump \u201cneeds a strong CFPB and a strong CFPB director,\u201d adding that \u201cif President Trump and Republicans decide to cower to Wall Street billionaires and destroy the agency, they will have a fight on their hands.\u201d\n     \nCNN\u2019s Jeanne Shahadi contributed to this report. \n \nThis story has been updated with additional content.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "Summary": "On Monday, President Donald Trump put a month-long pause on his planned tariffs on Canadian imports. Earlier in the day, though, he added two new items to his long list of inaccurate complaints about Canada.\n     \n            In a post on social media and then in comments to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump claimed that Canada prohibits US banks from opening or doing business there. In fact, various well-known US banks are open for business in Canada. And in those same Oval Office remarks, Trump claimed that Canada \u201cfor the most part\u201d doesn\u2019t accept US agricultural products. In fact, Canada is one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of US agricultural products \u2014 the No. 1 buyer for some of them.\n     \n            Here is a fact check.\n     \n            Trump wrote on social media on Monday morning: \u201cCanada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d In the Oval Office later in the day, Trump said he had raised this complaint with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n     \n            Trump said: \u201cCanada is very tough. Canada is very \u2014 you know, we\u2019re not treated well by Canada, and we have to be treated well. Banks are not, as an example, allowed \u2014 did you know that, that banks, American banks, are not allowed to do business in Canada. Can you believe that?\u201d\n     \n            Trump\u2019s claim is false, as four experts on banking regulation in Canada told CNN on Monday.\n     \n            \u201cThere\u2019s nothing prohibiting American banks from operating here, including having retail branches,\u201d Cristie Ford, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s law school, said in an email.\n     \n            Canada tightly regulates the banking industry, and it requires various government approvals before a foreign-owned bank can open in the country. But US banks have been operating in Canada for well over a century; the Canadian Bankers Association, an industry group, said in a statement on Monday that \u201cthere are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around C$113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada\u201d and that \u201cU.S. banks now make up approximately half of all foreign bank assets in Canada.\u201d\n     \n            Tyler Meredith, former head of economic and fiscal policy for Trudeau, noted on social media on Monday that Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bank, JPMorgan, and Northern Trust are among the US banks with current Canadian operations. You can see the others here and here.\n     \n            Meredith said in an interview that \u201cwe take a very careful look at people who want to come into our banking sector, because we consider financial services to be a core asset to Canada and to the Canadian economy\u201d and try hard to avoid the \u201ccascading consequences\u201d the world has seen with bank failures in the US \u2014 \u201cbut there are existing American institutions, Chinese institutions, Japanese institutions, and European institutions\u201d that have permission to operate in Canada.\n     \n            US banks can apply to launch a subsidiary in Canada, which is known as a \u201cSchedule II\u201d entity, or a \u201cbranch\u201d in Canada (not to be confused with a retail branch), which is known as a \u201cSchedule III\u201d entity.\n     \n            When a non-Canadian bank establishes a Canadian subsidiary, \u201cthat subsidiary will be subject to the same regulatory regime and capital requirements as a domestically owned and operated bank,\u201d said Bryce Tingle, a professor at the University of Calgary\u2019s law school, in an email. \u201cIt will have exactly the same powers and market access as a Canadian bank.\u201d\n     \nJeremy Kronick, director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Toronto, explained in an email that there are downsides to the subsidiary option from the perspective of foreign banks: a subsidiary is \u201ca separate legal entity from their parent, thus requiring their own local capital and liquidity structures. From the foreign bank\u2019s perspective, this is obviously inefficient.\u201d\n     \n            Most US banks operating in Canada have chosen the \u201cbranch\u201d option that does not subject them to the requirements of a subsidiary. However, there is a different restriction on branches: they are not allowed to accept deposits lower than $150,000 CAD.\n     \n            That, of course, means they can\u2019t conduct retail operations for average Canadian citizens \u2013 but they can engage in various profitable activities, for companies and wealthy individuals, that are less visible to the general public. The Canadian Bankers Association said the US banks in Canada \u201cspecialize in a range of financial services, including corporate and commercial lending, treasury services, credit card products, investment banking and mortgage financing.\u201d\n     \n            Kronick said: \u201cBottom line: there are trade-offs to each option, but foreign banks certainly can operate in Canada. A case could probably be made that the restrictions on both options prevent full competition with Canadian banks, but not that \u2018Canada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there\u2019 as Trump stated.\u201d\n     \n            In the Oval Office, Trump said of Canada: \u201cWe can\u2019t let them take advantage of the US. They don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part.\u201d He added shortly after: \u201cThey don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part, our milk and dairy, etc. A little bit they do, but not much.\u201d\n     \n            This is false, even with Trump\u2019s \u201cfor the most part\u201d and \u201ca little bit they do\u201d qualifiers.\n     \n            While Canada does limit foreign access to its dairy market in particular, Canada is nonetheless one of the top export markets for US dairy products and for agricultural products in general. Canada bought $27.9 billion worth of US agricultural exports in the 2023 fiscal year, making it the third-biggest buyer in the world behind only China ($33.7 billion) and Mexico ($28.2 billion).\n     \n            \u201cCanada consistently ranks among our top markets for agricultural product exports, representing one of our most significant and reliable trading partners,\u201d the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on its website last year.\n     \n            In 2023, USDA data shows, Canada was the top export market for US fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, ethanol, live animals, dog and cat food, and baked goods; the second-biggest export market for US dairy products and eggs and related products; the third-biggest export market for US poultry and related products excluding eggs; the fourth-biggest export market for US pork and related products; and the fifth-biggest export market for US beef and corn.\n     \n            While the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s (which was revised by a trade agreement during Trump\u2019s first term) left almost all US-Canada agricultural trade free of tariffs and quotas, there is always some friction between the two countries over certain elements of the trading relationship. Canada\u2019s protectionist \u201csupply management\u201d regime governing its dairy industry has for years been a source of irritation to Trump and to American lawmakers from both major parties.\n     \n            But the USDA says on its website: \u201cCanada is an important market for U.S. dairy products, second only to Mexico. From 2010 to 2021, total dairy exports from the United States to Canada, adjusted for inflation, rose 48 percent from $466.4 million in 2010 to $691.5 million in 2021.\u201d\n     \n            Regardless, it\u2019s certainly not true that Canada doesn\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d US farm products in general.\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

Still, fewer younger adults are thinking about retiring in the traditional sense one day. \"Retirement is becoming more deprioritized,\" said Michael Liersch, head of advice and planning at Wells Fargo. \"Ten or 15 years ago that was always the number one goal,\" he said. Now, \"actually living one's life in the moment is a bigger priority.\" Although this cohort is very focused on building wealth, \"the end game might not be no longer working and sitting on my Adirondack chair,\" he said. \"That just might not be it.\" More from Personal Finance:Why some say millennials have \u2018phantom wealth\u2019Higher-income consumers show signs of stress62% of couples keep at least some money separate More than one-third, or 37%, of Americans want a retirement that looks different from previous generations, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from Edelman Financial Engines. Most say that means a more active and adventurous lifestyle. And 32% say they will never be able to \"fully\" retire, the report found. \"This contrasts sharply with retirement stereotypes of the past, where stability and relaxation were the primary goals,\" the report said. Meanwhile, the median wealth of younger millennials and older Gen Zers \u2014 or those born in the 1990s \u2014 \"more than quadrupled\" in recent years, according to an analysis of 2022 data by the\u00a0St. Louis Federal Reserve. The number of millennials with seven-figure retirement balances also jumped 400% as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to a year earlier, according to data from Fidelity Investments prepared for CNBC. Compared to other generations, millennials are also more likely to say that their income went up over the last few months and that they expect their earnings potential to increase again in the year ahead, another report by\u00a0TransUnion found. Collectively, millennials are now worth about $15.95 trillion, up from $3.94 trillion five years earlier, according to the most recent Federal Reserve data as of the third quarter of 2024. But a lot has changed for younger generations, too, said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School. What assets millennials have on hand and their relative financial stability \"is determined by how they shape up against immediate needs \u2014 such as housing down payments or emergency medical payments \u2014 and their capacity to generate income to replace salaries and wages in retirement amidst the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions, or the elimination of workplace pensions all together,\" House said. Most younger adults are no longer getting pensions of any kind, so individuals who enter retirement age are now more dependent on personal savings and Social Security, he said. \"There are a lot of financial priorities that we are all trying to reach simultaneously,\" said Sophia Bera Daigle,\u00a0founder and CEO of\u00a0Gen Y Planning, a financial planning firm for millennials. Many millennials must contend with hefty\u00a0student loan balances, mortgages, car payments and child care costs in addition to saving for retirement or future college costs, she said. \"People are really feeling the cash crunch in their 30s to 40s,\" said Bera Daigle, a certified financial planner and a member of CNBC's\u00a0Advisor Council. \"Their net worth is going up but they don't feel like they are getting ahead.\" That has also contributed to changing views on retirement for millennials, she said. \"When I got into this business, retirement was about quitting the grind ... playing golf,\" Bera Daigle said. Now, \"it's really more about flexibility,\" she added. \"We don't know what retirement will look like in 20 years... there's a lot more emphasis on choosing the work they want to do in their 60s.\" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

For months, automakers have been taking a\u00a0\"wait-and-see\" approach\u00a0to the Trump administration's tariff threat.\u00a0That waiting period is coming to an end and automakers will likely need to implement prior contingency plans to attempt to offset additional costs in the coming weeks and months. Depending on the details, the tariffs on Mexico could have the greatest impact on the automotive industry, followed by Canada and then China, depending on the automaker. \"Any tariff action must be followed with a renegotiation of the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement], and a full review of the corporate trade regime that has devastated the American and global working class,\" Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers Union, said in a statement. General Motors and other major automakers did not immediately respond for comment regarding the tariffs Saturday night. Others such as Ford declined to comment, while\u00a0Honda\u00a0issued a broad statement: \"North American auto trade is key to the success of Honda globally and we look forward to a swift resolution that provides clarity and stability throughout the region.\" Most major automakers have factories in the U.S. However, they still rely heavily on imports from other countries including Mexico to meet American consumer demand. Nearly every major automaker operating in the U.S. has at least one plant in Mexico, including the six top-selling automakers, which accounted for more than 70% of U.S. sales in 2024. A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods, brought into the United States. The companies importing the goods pay the tariffs, and some fear the companies would simply pass any additional costs on to consumers \u2014 raising the cost of vehicles and potentially reducing demand. The formal announcement provides some clarity for companies but could cost automakers, many of which have produced vehicles without tariffs in Canada and Mexico for decades, billions of dollars. Uncertainty about trade\u00a0took a toll on GM\u00a0on Tuesday, when the automaker's stock had one of its worst days in years even after it beat Wall Street's expectations for its 2025 guidance and its top- and bottom-line for the fourth quarter.\u00a0 \"Our key take from GM's 4Q [earnings] result is that while the opportunity for GM is highly compelling, US policy uncertainty must be navigated for the time being,\" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an investor note Wednesday. GM did not account for potential tariffs in its guidance, which CFO Paul Jacobson described as a \"cautious\" approach given no duties on North American goods had been implemented yet. Both Jacobson and GM CEO Mary Barra said the company has contingency plans for any actions, but that wasn't enough to appease anxious investors. \"There's just so much noise,\" Jacobson told investors Tuesday, citing the inauguration and California wildfires, among other issues and events. \"We're being cautious until we get a little bit more smooth data from the marketplace just because January was so noisy.\" Tariffs could have a massive effect on the global automotive industry and potentially reduce earnings for companies such as GM, which has significant manufacturing operations across North America. \"Regardless of timing, these blanket tariffs would have a massive impact on the auto industry,\" S&P Global Mobility said in a report this week. \"Virtually no [automaker] or supplier\" operating in North America would be immune, according to the report. Nearly every major automaker operating in the U.S. has at least one plant in Mexico, including the six top-selling automakers, which accounted for more than 70% of U.S. sales in 2024. The industry is deeply integrated between the countries, with Mexico importing 49.4% of all auto parts from the U.S. In turn, Mexico exports 86.9% of its auto parts production to the U.S., according to the International Trade Administration. Wells Fargo estimates that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada imports would cost the traditional Detroit automaker billions of dollars a year. The firm estimates the impact of 5%, 10% and 25% tariffs on GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis would collectively be $13 billion, $25 billion and $56 billion, respectively. S&P Global Mobility, formerly IHS Markit, estimates a 25% duty on a $25,000 vehicle from Canada or Mexico would add $6,250 to its cost \u2014 some if not most of which could be passed on to the consumer. S&P Mobility reports plants in Canada and Mexico produce roughly 5.3 million vehicles, with about 70% \u2014 nearly 4 million \u2014 destined for the U.S. Mexico accounted for a majority of those vehicles, as five automakers\u00a0\u2014 Ford, GM, Stellantis, Toyota Motor and Honda \u2014 produced only\u00a0an estimated 1.3 million light-duty vehicles in 2024 in Canada, largely for the U.S. market, according to a Canadian manufacturing nonprofit research group. Some of those automakers also heavily rely on production in Mexico, but not all producers would face the same disruptions. On a percentage of sales basis, German automaker Volkswagen is the most exposed to tariff risk in Mexico, followed by Nissan Motor and Stellantis, S&P Global Mobility reports. \"We are working, obviously, on scenarios,\" Antonio Filosa, head of Stellantis' North American operations, said Jan. 10. \"But yes, we need to await his decisions and after the decision of Mr. Trump and his administration, we will work accordingly.\" Here are the automakers that are most exposed to tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico, based on the percentage of their U.S. sales being produced south of the border: Got a confidential news tip?

Apple's earnings report shows why I always say \"own it, don't trade it.\" Where it has launched Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 sells better. High-margin services revenues was better. Mac better. Accessories better. Europe better. India better. Expanding gross margins helped make the numbers, too. Shares are up about 4% Friday.  2. China is still a question mark for Apple, though. Revenues down 11% there in the quarter. Apple Intelligence still needs government approval to launch. Rivals Huawei and Xiaomi can access the AI from buzzy Chinese startup DeepSeek. What can Apple get to reverse its fortunes in China? Will Baidu be its AI partner? 3. The U.S. government is looking into whether DeepSeek used third-parties in Singapore to acquire Nvidia chips that Washington has banned in China, according to Bloomberg News. Club name Nvidia says it plays by the rules in Singapore, and that its revenue from the island country does not indicate diversion.  4. We know Tesla, Club stock Meta and Oracle want all the high-end Nvidia chips they can get, even with DeepSeek's emergence. We don't know about Club names Alphabet or Amazon, which both report next week. What if one of the two says we are reassessing our orders for Nvidia's next-gen AI platform Blackwell? What happens to the stock? What if Amazon, another Club holding, says it's leaning into using AMD? I made a call on Nvidia stock for Club members yesterday.  5. Geopolitics remain part of the Nvidia dilemma. Does DeepSeek have a juicer that can make 10 glasses of orange juice out of a single orange, or does it have 10 government-subsidized juicers that it just won't tell us about? If it is 10 juicers, I worry that President Donald Trump will just ban all semiconductor exports to China.  6. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, currently set to take effect Saturday, may exclude oil, the president told reporters Thursday night. U.S. oil benchmark WTI was slightly higher Friday, to roughly $73  barrel. The U.S. dollar index strengthened, but it's still below its recent highs set earlier this month.  7. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all set to open higher Friday. Stock futures held onto their gains after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge matched expectations for December. The PCE index rose 0.3% month over month and, when excluding food and energy, 2.8% on an annual basis.  8. Intel showed some cost discipline and improved cash flow in its quarterly results. But the fourth quarter is typically strong for them, and there might have been some pull-through ahead of higher tariffs on Chinese imports. The PC market is weak. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo cut their price targets on the struggling chip stock. Shares added more than 1% Friday.  9. Atlassian shares jumped almost 20% on the back of a very good quarter. The company, which trades under the ticker TEAM, makes pure enterprise software that makes it easier to share\u00a0and simplify. Seems unstoppable. 10. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' non-opioid painkiller Journavx, which blocks pain signals sent to the brain at their origin. This drug could be a blockbuster, and it's been on my radar for a while now.

        "Summary": "On Monday, President Donald Trump put a month-long pause on his planned tariffs on Canadian imports. Earlier in the day, though, he added two new items to his long list of inaccurate complaints about Canada.\n     \n            In a post on social media and then in comments to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump claimed that Canada prohibits US banks from opening or doing business there. In fact, various well-known US banks are open for business in Canada. And in those same Oval Office remarks, Trump claimed that Canada \u201cfor the most part\u201d doesn\u2019t accept US agricultural products. In fact, Canada is one of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of US agricultural products \u2014 the No. 1 buyer for some of them.\n     \n            Here is a fact check.\n     \n            Trump wrote on social media on Monday morning: \u201cCanada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d In the Oval Office later in the day, Trump said he had raised this complaint with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n     \n            Trump said: \u201cCanada is very tough. Canada is very \u2014 you know, we\u2019re not treated well by Canada, and we have to be treated well. Banks are not, as an example, allowed \u2014 did you know that, that banks, American banks, are not allowed to do business in Canada. Can you believe that?\u201d\n     \n            Trump\u2019s claim is false, as four experts on banking regulation in Canada told CNN on Monday.\n     \n            \u201cThere\u2019s nothing prohibiting American banks from operating here, including having retail branches,\u201d Cristie Ford, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s law school, said in an email.\n     \n            Canada tightly regulates the banking industry, and it requires various government approvals before a foreign-owned bank can open in the country. But US banks have been operating in Canada for well over a century; the Canadian Bankers Association, an industry group, said in a statement on Monday that \u201cthere are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around C$113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada\u201d and that \u201cU.S. banks now make up approximately half of all foreign bank assets in Canada.\u201d\n     \n            Tyler Meredith, former head of economic and fiscal policy for Trudeau, noted on social media on Monday that Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bank, JPMorgan, and Northern Trust are among the US banks with current Canadian operations. You can see the others here and here.\n     \n            Meredith said in an interview that \u201cwe take a very careful look at people who want to come into our banking sector, because we consider financial services to be a core asset to Canada and to the Canadian economy\u201d and try hard to avoid the \u201ccascading consequences\u201d the world has seen with bank failures in the US \u2014 \u201cbut there are existing American institutions, Chinese institutions, Japanese institutions, and European institutions\u201d that have permission to operate in Canada.\n     \n            US banks can apply to launch a subsidiary in Canada, which is known as a \u201cSchedule II\u201d entity, or a \u201cbranch\u201d in Canada (not to be confused with a retail branch), which is known as a \u201cSchedule III\u201d entity.\n     \n            When a non-Canadian bank establishes a Canadian subsidiary, \u201cthat subsidiary will be subject to the same regulatory regime and capital requirements as a domestically owned and operated bank,\u201d said Bryce Tingle, a professor at the University of Calgary\u2019s law school, in an email. \u201cIt will have exactly the same powers and market access as a Canadian bank.\u201d\n     \nJeremy Kronick, director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Toronto, explained in an email that there are downsides to the subsidiary option from the perspective of foreign banks: a subsidiary is \u201ca separate legal entity from their parent, thus requiring their own local capital and liquidity structures. From the foreign bank\u2019s perspective, this is obviously inefficient.\u201d\n     \n            Most US banks operating in Canada have chosen the \u201cbranch\u201d option that does not subject them to the requirements of a subsidiary. However, there is a different restriction on branches: they are not allowed to accept deposits lower than $150,000 CAD.\n     \n            That, of course, means they can\u2019t conduct retail operations for average Canadian citizens \u2013 but they can engage in various profitable activities, for companies and wealthy individuals, that are less visible to the general public. The Canadian Bankers Association said the US banks in Canada \u201cspecialize in a range of financial services, including corporate and commercial lending, treasury services, credit card products, investment banking and mortgage financing.\u201d\n     \n            Kronick said: \u201cBottom line: there are trade-offs to each option, but foreign banks certainly can operate in Canada. A case could probably be made that the restrictions on both options prevent full competition with Canadian banks, but not that \u2018Canada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there\u2019 as Trump stated.\u201d\n     \n            In the Oval Office, Trump said of Canada: \u201cWe can\u2019t let them take advantage of the US. They don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part.\u201d He added shortly after: \u201cThey don\u2019t take our agricultural product for the most part, our milk and dairy, etc. A little bit they do, but not much.\u201d\n     \n            This is false, even with Trump\u2019s \u201cfor the most part\u201d and \u201ca little bit they do\u201d qualifiers.\n     \n            While Canada does limit foreign access to its dairy market in particular, Canada is nonetheless one of the top export markets for US dairy products and for agricultural products in general. Canada bought $27.9 billion worth of US agricultural exports in the 2023 fiscal year, making it the third-biggest buyer in the world behind only China ($33.7 billion) and Mexico ($28.2 billion).\n     \n            \u201cCanada consistently ranks among our top markets for agricultural product exports, representing one of our most significant and reliable trading partners,\u201d the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on its website last year.\n     \n            In 2023, USDA data shows, Canada was the top export market for US fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, ethanol, live animals, dog and cat food, and baked goods; the second-biggest export market for US dairy products and eggs and related products; the third-biggest export market for US poultry and related products excluding eggs; the fourth-biggest export market for US pork and related products; and the fifth-biggest export market for US beef and corn.\n     \n            While the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s (which was revised by a trade agreement during Trump\u2019s first term) left almost all US-Canada agricultural trade free of tariffs and quotas, there is always some friction between the two countries over certain elements of the trading relationship. Canada\u2019s protectionist \u201csupply management\u201d regime governing its dairy industry has for years been a source of irritation to Trump and to American lawmakers from both major parties.\n     \n            But the USDA says on its website: \u201cCanada is an important market for U.S. dairy products, second only to Mexico. From 2010 to 2021, total dairy exports from the United States to Canada, adjusted for inflation, rose 48 percent from $466.4 million in 2010 to $691.5 million in 2021.\u201d\n     \n            Regardless, it\u2019s certainly not true that Canada doesn\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d US farm products in general.\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

        "Summary": "Markets \n\n\n Hot Stocks \n\n\n Fear & Greed Index \n\n\n \n            Latest Market News \n\n\n \n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n Follow: \n            On Saturday, President Donald Trump made good on his promise to impose steep tariffs on America\u2019s three largest trading partners \u2014 Canada, China and Mexico \u2014 citing a national emergency on the flow of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants into the United States.\n     \n            The action, which is expected to take effect on Tuesday, includes a 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada (there\u2019s a 10% carve-out for energy-related items such as crude oil), and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the United States.\n     \n            Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.\n     \n            However, economists warn that these moves negatively impact American businesses and consumers, many of whom are still reeling from the sharp rise in inflation in recent years.\n     \n            The US Chamber of Commerce warned Saturday that tariffs won\u2019t solve the yearslong issues at the borders and instead threaten to \u201cupend supply chains\u201d and raise prices for American families.\n     \n            \u201cConsumers are going to be clearly worse off,\u201d Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics, told CNN on Saturday.\n     \n            \u201cWhen you talk about a tariff, it\u2019s an economic war; and in war, everybody loses,\u201d he added. \u201cBut hopefully we will come to some better results and conclusions as a result of the pain and suffering that we will go through.\u201d\n     \n            About one-third of US imports come from the three countries Trump targeted Saturday. Their products are among some of the most commonplace and critical items used by Americans, including fruits and vegetables, meat, gas, automobiles, electronics, toys, clothing, lumber, and beer and spirits.\n     \n            Mexico and Canada supply a significant share of several key food categories. For example, Mexico is the largest supplier of fruit and vegetables to the US, while Canada leads in exports of grain, livestock and meats, poultry and more.\n     \n            Agricultural products from Mexico and Canada, in particular, could become more expensive for consumers, as grocery retailers operate on thinner profit margins than most industries. With little room to absorb higher tariff costs, the grocers may have to pass them on to shoppers.\n     \n            Although the US typically exports more agricultural goods than it imports, the value of imports has increased faster than that of exports in the past decade, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Additionally, climate change has increased US reliance on countries like Mexico, where growing conditions are more favorable.\n     \n            Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to USDA data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.\n     \n            But the biggest category of agricultural imports from Mexico last year was fresh fruits, of which the US imported $9 billion worth, with avocados accounting for $3.1 billion of that total.\n     \n            The US imported $97 billion worth of oil and gas from Canada last year, that country\u2019s top export to the US. The US has become more reliant on Canadian oil since the expansion of Canada\u2019s Trans Mountain pipeline, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.\n     \n            The tariff on Canadian energy products is only 10%, not the 25% tariff announced on other Canadian exports.\n     \n             That\u2019ll limit the impact on gasoline prices, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n     \n            Another factor is the time of year. Gas prices are typically near a low for the year in February due to weak demand. If the tariffs stay in place through summer, the impact will be greater, he said.\n     \n            And while the impact isn\u2019t expected to be felt equally nationwide, it likely will hit America\u2019s Heartland the hardest.\n     \n            Most Canadian oil is shipped to Midwest refineries via pipeline, Kloza said. The states most likely to be affected are Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin, he said.\n     \n            \u201cInterestingly, 12 of those 16 states begin February with an average retail gasoline price under $3 a gallon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat probably won\u2019t last.\u201d\n     \n            The US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, the top two goods imported from there that year, according to Commerce Department data. (December trade data is due out next week.)\n     \n            Motor vehicles were also the second-largest good the US imported from Canada last year through November, for a total of $34 billion.\n     \n            The auto sector is likely \u201capoplectic\u201d about the new potential tariffs, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. US car companies have been able to keep production costs down by hiring lower-wage workers, particularly in Mexico, where much of their production has shifted to in recent years.\n     \n            But that cost saving will essentially be erased if there\u2019s a 25% tariff, she said. Car manufacturers are unlikely to move their production elsewhere, given they\u2019ve made sizable investments in existing plants in both countries and it is difficult to source all the raw materials to build cars and their parts from other places.\n     \n            While the United States is not the manufacturing-focused economy it once was, it still consumes tens of millions of tons of steel a year, feeding industries such as automaking, oil production, construction and infrastructure.\n     \n            Canada and Mexico are the largest and third-largest exporters of steel to the United States, respectively. In his first term, President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel imports from most nations worldwide effective June 2018. But Mexico and Canada, under their free trade deals with the United States, were exempt from those tariffs.\n     \n            Canada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group.\n     \n            However, there is empirical evidence showing that the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum did raise prices, Won Sohn said, noting a 2020 Federal Reserve study that found an increase in producer prices, which eventually were passed along to consumers.\n     \n            Beer and liquor may be recession-proof, but they\u2019re certainly not tariff-proof.\n     \n            The result would be a stiff penalty on some of America\u2019s favorite libations, including tequila, which can be made only in Mexico and the No. 1 beer brand in the nation, Modelo.\n     \nConstellation Brands, which imports Modelo and Corona beer as well as Casa Noble tequila from Mexico, could see its costs leap 16% under Trump\u2019s proposed tariff and would likely have to raise prices by about 4.5%, Chris Carey, a Wells Fargo equity analyst, wrote in a November note.\n     \n            In 2023, the US imported $5.69 billion of beer and $4.81 billion of alcohol from Mexico, according to International Trade Administration data. When combined, the two categories were the 10th-biggest import from Mexico last year and mark a sharp 126% increase from 2017, International Trade Administration data shows.\n     \n            While the tariffs could cause further increases in key materials (such as steel, aluminum and grain) for US beer and spirits businesses, the industry is also bracing for the potential of retaliatory tariffs.\n     \n            Softwood lumber, which is sourced from the likes of pine, spruce, firs and other conifers is prized for its light weight, workability and strength.\n     \n            As such, its applications are vast, but it\u2019s a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry: Commonly, the skeleton and skin of homes \u2014 the framing, roof and siding \u2014 consist of softwood lumber.\n     \n            And 30% of what the US uses annually comes from Canada.\n     \n            Economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that taxing \u2014 or worse, cutting off \u2014 Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.\n     \n            \u201cWhether it\u2019s lumber tariffs or tariffs on any other import, these can impact the supply chain,\u201d said Nick Erickson, senior director of housing policy for Housing First Minnesota, a trade organization that represents builders, remodelers and other businesses in the North Star State. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen in the past that tariffs on lumber, these are paid for by new homebuyers in the cost of their home.\u201d\n     \n            And it\u2019s not just lumber at risk for tariffs: 71% of the imported $456 million of lime and gypsum (which are used for drywall) came from Mexico in 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n     \n            Factoring in the other raw materials and components imported from Canada, Mexico, as well as China (notably the steel, aluminum and home appliances already subject to tariffs), Trump\u2019s new tariffs could raise the cost of imported construction materials by $3 billion to $4 billion, the NAHB noted.\n     \n            Consumer electronics are among the top goods the US imported from China last year, according to federal trade data. That includes cellphones, TVs, laptops, video game consoles, monitors and all the components that power them.\n     \n            China also is a major supplier of home appliances. Those along with toys and footwear are   particularly exposed to Trump\u2019s tariff threats.\n     \n            A staggering 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.\n     \n            More than half (56%) of shoes sold in the United States are made in China, the trade group said.\n     \n            The United States is also reliant on China for toys and sporting equipment, including items such as footballs, soccer balls and baseballs. The United States gets 75% of its imported toys and sports equipment from China.\n     \n  CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore, David Goldman, Matt Egan, and Annette Choi contributed to this report.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The company said in a statement that users will \"be able to travel across 37 square miles of Austin \u2014 from Hyde Park, to Downtown, to Montopolis\" \u2014 when the Uber-Waymo service launches soon. The list allows users to receive Uber updates and bolsters their odds of being matched with a Waymo autonomous vehicle upon launch. The vehicles that will be part of the Austin service are Jaguar i-Pace electric models equipped with Waymo's driverless systems and labeled with both Waymo and Uber branding. The Waymo rides in Austin will only be available through the Uber app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where riders hail them through the Waymo One app. Uber faced investor pressure last year to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy after Tesla promised it would soon start producing robotaxis, and had begun testing a ride-hailing app with some of its employees. While Tesla does not make vehicles that are safe to use without a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at all times, Elon Musk's automaker in January said it will \"begin launching\" a driverless ride-hailing business \"later this year\" starting in Austin. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, testing and operating a commercial robotaxi service in the state does not require the same types of special licenses and permits that other states require. \"Texas\u00a0law allows for AV testing and operations on\u00a0Texas roadways as long as they meet the same safety and insurance requirements as every other vehicle on the road,\" a spokesperson for the department told CNBC by email. Uber reported revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 20% on Wednesday, topping analysts' estimates. But the stock slid as the company issued weak bookings guidance for the first quarter.

Tesla sold 63,238 units of its electric cars in January, down 11.5% from the 71,447 cars sold in the same month last year. Shares of Tesla were down about 1.5% in premarket trading. Chinese rival BYD meanwhile sold 296,446 pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles last month, up 47% year-on-year. Other Chinese rivals of Tesla, including Changan Automobile and Xpeng, also posted growth in sales. Tesla has attempted to use price cuts as an incentive to retain Chinese' buyers interest in its car. Late last year, Tesla slashed the price of its Model Y car and also extended a zero-interest five-year loan plan until the end of January. Last month, the U.S. giant also announced a revamped version of the Model Y \u2014 one of its best-selling EV autos \u2014 in China. This also came with a 0% interest plan. Tesla has not introduced a new model since it began delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, which starts at nearly $80,000. Investors have been yearning for a new mass-market model from the company to reinvigorate sales.  Tesla has said a new affordable model could be launched in the first half of 2025. Meanwhile, the automaker is pushing to launch its driver assist system, which it markets as \"Full Self Driving,\" in China this year, as rivals also roll out similar features.

Honda is in the midst of completing more than $1 billion in new investments \u2014 upped Wednesday from an initially announced $700 million \u2014 in the state this year. Upgrades most notably include installing six \"giga presses,\" which were made well-known by Tesla, and a new \"cell\" manufacturing system for its upcoming electric vehicle battery cases. The company's emerging EV hub in Ohio, including a separate $3.5 billion battery plant, will be the flagship for Honda's global manufacturing operations. That includes its Marysville Auto Plant being capable of producing traditional vehicles, hybrids and EVs on the same assembly line, officials said during a daylong tour of the operations. \"The Honda EV hub in Ohio is establishing the global standard for EV production for people, for technology and for processes,\" said Mike Fischer, North American lead for Honda's battery-electric vehicle projects. \"As we expand EV production regionally and globally, this is the footprint and the characteristic performance that will be used.\" Typically such important manufacturing changes would begin in Honda's home country of Japan and then get rolled out to facilities in the U.S. and elsewhere, according to company officials. The Ohio investments were initially announced in October 2022 as part of the Biden administration's push to on-shore manufacturing. They remain important amid threats of potential increases in tariffs for imported products such as automobiles by President Donald Trump. Honda produced more than 1 million vehicles at five U.S. assembly plants in 2024. About 64% percent were sold in the U.S., while the remainder were exported. It has one assembly plant in Mexico. Once completed, Honda will be able to produce roughly 220,000 vehicles annually at its Marysville plant, located in central Ohio outside of Columbus. The 4 million-square-foot facility currently produces several Honda and Acura vehicles, which are expected to be joined later this year by an all-electric Acura RSX crossover \u2014 the first EV produced by Honda. The Japanese automaker was late to invest in EVs compared with other automakers. It currently sells two all-electric crossovers \u2014 Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX \u2014 in the U.S., but those vehicles are produced by General Motors in Mexico. The new Acura crossover will be followed by the Honda 0 SUV and Honda 0 Saloon EV prototypes the company debuted last month at CES in Las Vegas. The aluminum battery packs for the new EVs will be produced at Honda's nearby engine complex in Anna, Ohio \u2014 the company's largest engine facility globally that has grown from a small rectangle building in 1985 to a more than 2.8-million-square feet plant. \"We're establishing this large aluminum production technology for all Honda,\" Tim Stroh, EV battery case project leader, said. \"The goal here is to roll that out to other products, other factors across the world.\" To produce the battery packs and other EV components, as well as potentially engines in the future, the company is installing six massive, 6,000-ton high-pressure die cast machines that will \"megacast,\" or \"gigacast\" materials, as Tesla has referred to it. The massive machines are the size of a small house and use an enormous amount of pressure to form parts. Current Honda presses go up to 3,500 tons in Ohio. Done correctly, gigacasting can theoretically slash per-unit manufacturing costs by eliminating the welding of dozens of body parts by casting one single module, according to S&P Global Mobility. Once the packs are cast, they will be shipped from Anna to Marysville and other plants to have battery cells from Honda's joint venture operations with LG Energy Solution installed before being used in the final assembly of EVs. To combine the battery cells and packs in Marysville, Honda is installing nearly 60 flexible manufacturing \"cells,\" or zones, for the battery assembly. Instead of a traditional assembly line, where parts are installed as a vehicle moves, the new production process occurs parallel to the main line in zones that make it so any potential slowdowns or problems don't impact the main line. \"This is considered the second founding for Honda,\" said Bob Schwyn, senior vice president of Honda Development and Manufacturing of America. \"We're using the opportunity to reimagine our approach to manufacturing.\" Honda has referred to its transition to electric vehicles, including fuel cells, as its \"second founding.\" Despite slower-than-expected adoption of EVs in the U.S., the company maintains previously announced goal of achieving zero environmental impact by 2050, through three critical action areas: carbon neutrality, clean energy and resource circulation. That goals also includes exclusively selling zero-emissions vehicles by 2040. Many other automakers have delayed or withdrawn such targets in recent years. The more than $1 billion investments in current Ohio facilities also include several new manufacturing processes and techniques to lower emissions and waste, including using a special form of structural aluminum for the EV battery packs that can be recycled and reused. \"We're using the opportunity to reimagine our approach to manufacturing and create new value in the area of environmental responsibility,\" Schwyn said. \"This includes strategies to recapture our products at end-of-life and then recycle or reuse 100% of the materials, especially finite materials for EV batteries to essentially make new Hondas out of old Hondas.\" Got a confidential news tip?

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday he spoke with Musk \u2014 who also leads President Donald Trump's government-shrinking group DOGE \u2014 in the wake of a deadly plane crash above Washington, D.C., last week. \"We're going to remake our airspace, and we're going to do it quickly,\" Duffy said after praising Musk as a \"pretty remarkable guy\" with \"access to the best technological people, the best engineers in the world.\" Duffy later Wednesday wrote on Musk's social media site X that DOGE is \"going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.\" Musk replied, \"With the support of President @realDonaldTrump, the @DOGE team will aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system.\" But Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees air traffic control, said that Musk should not be allowed anywhere near those reform efforts. \"It's a clear conflict of interest,\" Cantwell told reporters Thursday. The senator from Washington state said Musk has been \"fined for violations.\" She was referencing the Federal Aviation Administration proposing $633,000 in civil penalties against SpaceX last year over the company's alleged failures to follow licensing rules during two rocket launches in 2023. Musk had responded to that proposed fine by threatening to sue the FAA for \"regulatory overreach.\" Days later, he publicly urged then-FAA chief Michael Whitaker to resign. Cantwell said, \"At a time when you need the FAA to call the shots and say, 'Don't launch now because there could be a conflict in the airspace,' the last thing I want is that guy trying to control the airspace.\" Whitaker stepped down on Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, after running the agency for less than 15 months. The move left the FAA without a Senate-confirmed head for the first days of Trump's second term, including the day when the American Airlines flight collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter in D.C. Trump appointed Christopher Rocheleau as acting FAA commissioner one day after the crash, which left 67 people dead. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., sent Musk a letter last week questioning his role in Whitaker's resignation. In a letter shared later Thursday, Cantwell asked Duffy to \"make sure that all conflicts of interest between the FAA and Elon Musk are removed.\" Cantwell wrote to Duffy that during their most recent conversation, \"You did not discuss your intention to involve Elon Musk in the FAA's safety systems or process.\" \"It is a conflict of interest for someone whose company is regulated by the federal government to be involved in anything that affects his personal financial interest, his company or his competitors,\" the senator wrote. Cantwell also noted that Whitaker had been unanimously confirmed by the Senate. \u2014 CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Hey, anything's possible,\" he said. \"But if you had to design the most punitive way to bring down the price of this great stock, you'd invent something like DeepSeek.\" Earlier this week, investors were stunned to find out DeepSeek developed an AI model that it said cost $6 million to make \u2014 significantly less than what its peers spend on such programs. The company also claimed that the model could outperform that of industry favorite OpenAI. Wall Street concluded Big Tech may not need to spend as much money on highly-advanced chips from Nvidia, which until now seemed like the only option for companies looking to dominate in the AI world. Worries of lower earnings sent Nvidia shares plummeting, with the stock losing nearly $600 billion in one session, the largest single-day drop in market history. Cramer conceded that investors' response is logical if DeepSeek's model actually cost so little to make, forcing Nvidia to bring down prices. But he said there's a possibility that DeepSeek spent more on its program than investors believe, referencing a new report from SemiAnalysis,\u00a0a semiconductor research and consulting firm. SemiAnalysis suggested the way DeepSeek framed the development of the new model is misleading, saying the company could have actually spent more than $500 million. Cramer was also skeptical that executives at tech giants like Meta, Tesla and Oracle would have invested so much money in Nvidia without performing proper due diligence. DeepSeek wasn't a secret, he continued, it just received a lot of attention this week. \"I think the SemiAnalysis piece is spot on,\" he said. \"It may just be one more long knife aimed at Nvidia, and nothing more.\" Nvidia declined to comment. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to request for comment. Click here to download\u00a0Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing\u00a0at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

They're different from true self- driving cars. There are safety features, such as the descriptively named \"automatic emergency braking,\" which will stop the vehicle to prevent a collision with an object or person. There are also convenience features, like lane centering, which is also what it sounds like \u2014 a technology that helps keep a vehicle in the center of a lane. Each system is different, and they all have strengths and weaknesses. Higher ranked systems are not necessarily better than lower-rated ones in every single way. The Mercedes-Benz system Consumer Reports rated on its EQE 350 SUV was especially strong, better than just about every other contender in terms of how it executed a lot of common functions, and in terms of some features not seen on some rivals, such as a display right in front of the driver. The Mercedes system also collaborates with drivers, allowing them to take over the wheel to avoid a pothole without shutting the automated system off entirely, for example. The Tesla doesn't have that collaborative aspect and will shut off if the driver jerks the wheel. But the Mercedes-Benz EQE electric SUV in Consumer Reports' fleet was lacking a feature found on the two top rated systems \u2014 Ford's BlueCruise, and General Motor's Super Cruise. That was a driver monitoring camera, which watches the driver to ensure eyes stay on the road. \"If it were to have that driver monitoring camera, it would easily be number one,\" Funkhouser said. \"Easily.\"\u00a0 Watch the video to learn more.

The main topic Huang and Trump are expected to discuss is U.S. artificial intelligence policy, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the plans. China's DeepSeek is likely to be part of the discussion, but the meeting is seen as a way for both leaders to get to know one another, the sources said. Top technology CEOs have embraced Trump in recent months to a degree not seen in his first administration. But this is the first meeting between Huang and Trump since the president started his second term last week. Many other industry leaders were at Trump's inauguration. They included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. They also donated to the event either individually or through their company. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has emerged as one of Trump's top advisors, after heavily financing his campaign. Musk is implementing policy for the Trump administration through his oversight of an outside advisory council, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. On Inauguration Day, Huang visited Nvidia offices in China. Trump and Huang have a lot to discuss as Nvidia, now the third most-valuable U.S. company, faces several regulatory challenges related to international demand for its AI chips. The most powerful Nvidia AI chips have export restrictions preventing them from going to countries like China and Russia \u2014 and soon a host of other countries. CNBC has confirmed U.S. chip restrictions on China are currently being evaluated by the White House. The two will also likely discuss the so-called diffusion rules that were announced by the Biden administration in its final days. The rules severely limit chips sales overseas and prompted a sharp response from both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. They're expected go into effect this year, but Trump has the power to reverse them. Huang and Trump are also expected to discuss investments in U.S. chip production, the sources said, as the Commerce Department looks to revamp the previous administration's CHIPS Act that subsidized companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to build new chip foundries on U.S. soil. Most of Nvidia's chips are fabricated at the most advanced factories in Taiwan, which are operated by TSMC. WATCH: DeepSeek and China's broad tech advancement Got a confidential news tip?

After showing a carrying value of $184 million in digital assets for the prior four quarters, the number suddenly jumped to $1.08 billion in the December period, Tesla reported in its earnings release on Wednesday. The increase followed a recent policy change from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which mandates that corporate digital asset holdings be marked to market each quarter starting at the beginning of 2025. Before the FASB rule change, companies owning bitcoin had to report their holdings at the lowest value recorded during their ownership, regardless of any subsequent price gain. Tesla said in its earnings deck that the change resulted in an earnings per share boost of 68 cents in the quarter, and CFO Vaibhav Taneja noted on the earnings call that the net income increase was $600 million. \"It's important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets,\" Taneja said. At the end of the third quarter, Tesla's bitcoin holdings were recorded at a carrying value of $184 million, though their fair market value was significantly higher at $729 million. That means the actual increase in the value of its holdings in the period was about $347 million, reflecting bitcoin's fourth-quarter rally. Much of the recent gain in bitcoin is tied to optimism surrounding the second Trump administration, which was heavily backed by the crypto industry. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was Trump's biggest financial supporter and is now a top adviser in the White House. Longtime Musk ally David Sacks was tapped by Trump to the be the White House AI and crypto czar.  Bitcoin tracking website\u00a0Bitcoin Treasuries ranks Tesla as the sixth-biggest holder of bitcoin among public companies. Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue fell short of analysts' expectations on Wednesday as auto revenue dropped 8% from a year earlier, yet the stock climbed in after-hours trading.  \u2014 CNBC'S Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

The stock was also hit by declining registrations for Tesla vehicles in France, Sweden and Norway. Tesla fell more than its megacap peers, with Apple's stock suffering the next-biggest drop at more than 3%. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0over the weekend slapped 10% tariffs on goods imported from\u00a0China, where Tesla produces about half its automobiles. While the tariffs are sure to hit all automakers' supply chains, Tesla operates factories in the U.S., Berlin and Shanghai, enabling it to sidestep some of the challenges faced by other electric vehicle makers. During Tesla's earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said the company's profitability could take a hit if the new administration implements tariffs.\u00a0 \"Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses,\" Taneja said. He said the \"imposition of tariffs\" would \"have an impact on our business and profitability.\" As for falling registrations in Europe, the drop was steepest in France, one of the continent's largest EV markets. Tesla registrations there fell 63% in January from the same month a year earlier, according to data tracked by industry association PFA, or Plateforme Automobile. That was a much steeper drop than the decline in electric cars and in overall automotive sales in France. In Sweden and Norway, Tesla sales for January fell 44% and 38%, respectively, Reuters reported. In addition to the tariffs and news about declining registrations, Tesla over the weekend also cut lease prices for its base Model 3 sedan and unpainted steel Cybertruck vehicles, according to listings for customers in the U.S. viewed by CNBC. An independent researcher who publishes his Tesla forecasts under the handle \"Troy Teslike\" on Patreon wrote, in a post on social media site X, that he only expects Tesla to sell about 21,000 units of its Cybertruck in 2025. \"The order backlog is gone,\" he wrote. \"Tesla ended 2024 with 10,600 unsold Cybertrucks because of too much production and low demand. The backlog dropped to zero on November 24, 2024, when Tesla's order page in the US showed that customers could order and take delivery of a Cybertruck on the same day.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a major backer of Trump's presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House. Musk also recently\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. As CNBC previously reported, Musk's incendiary rhetoric and political activism have contributed to a decline in Tesla's brand value and reputation. Tesla's brand value fell 26% in 2024, according to consulting firm Brand Finance. WATCH: Tesla stock is disconnected from fundamentals Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

He said he is \"pretty optimistic\" that national security will focus on ways to protect American innovation from manipulation and theft. DeepSeek rocked technology markets this week when its open-source model beat out OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top free app on Apple's U.S. App store. Stocks sold off Monday, with Nvidia registering the most significant one-day market value loss in history. Claims and estimates that the model cost less than competitors to make spurred questions about the hefty capital expenditures megacap tech has funneled into AI. Karp said he does not \"really believe\" the cost estimates surrounding DeepSeek's creation. Palantir has been one of the stories of Wall Street of late, with shares up more than 425% over the past year and outperforming all other members of the S&P 500 in 2024. The stock is up 12% since the start of January and gained more than 4% to a record on Friday. The company is now valued at close to $200 billion. Palantir's growth in recent years has stemmed from ballooning demand for AI solutions, where Karp says the company is leading the charge and is poised to transform the way American companies run. Improving the U.S is the company's \"primary objective,\" he said. Karp, a vocal supporter of Israel since the Oct. 7 attack, also backed up his stance and commented on controversy surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Historians and politicians viewed Musk's hand gestures at an inauguration event for President Donald Trump as a Nazi salute. Karp said any idea that Musk is a Nazi is \"completely absurd and a complete rewrite of history.\" Musk has also echoed support for Israel and visited the country shortly after the attack. While Karp stayed out of politics in the recent presidential election, he offered support for the national security stance on illegal immigration. He said people should not \"have a right\" to be in the U.S. if they entered illegally, especially if they have engaged in crimes. \"The average American or European as an example are really decent, compassionate, wonderful people, and there is no reason for them to tolerate someone engaged in severe criminal activity in their society,\" he said.

        "Summary": "Americans don\u2019t know the full extent of what Elon Musk is doing as he embeds alongside President Donald Trump at the top of the federal government.\n     \n            What we know is that he\u2019s the world\u2019s richest man, the president\u2019s largest campaign benefactor, and a person whose companies have grown fat on government contracts, so he has a greater financial interest in how the government operates than your average naturalized immigrant.\n     \n            With that context in mind, consider this startling passage from a report by CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz, Phil Mattingly and Tierney Sneed about a standoff between career officials at the Treasury Department and employees of DOGE, the Musk-allied Department of Government Efficiency, which has morphed after the election from the out-of-government advisory panel Trump talked about to a rebranded technology unit inside the White House complex. Mattingly, Polantz and Sneed write:\n     \nThe top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, is leaving unexpectedly after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n \n \nAccording to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had asked about Treasury\u2019s ability to stop payments. But Lebryk\u2019s pushback was, \u201cWe don\u2019t do that,\u201d the person said. \n \n \n\u201cThey seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau\u2019s role to decide which payments to make \u2014 it is \u201cjust to make the f-ing payments.\u201d \n \n \n            \u201cThis is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!\u201d he wrote on the social media platform he owns, pushing people to rally at events opposing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund NGOs, nonprofits unaffiliated with the government that are supposed to do good works.\n     \n            Think Catholic Relief Services, the World Food Program and Save the Children. There can be a legitimate debate about whether the US should fund those programs in part because we know, thanks to transparency, that the US government is funding those programs.\n     \n            But his method of taking over the bureaucracy is much less transparent than the bureaucracy itself.\n     \n            When Bill Clinton offered buyouts to federal workers, in 1993, for instance, he did so after getting buy-in from Congress. Trump\u2019s administration is banking on a slim majority of Republicans in the House buying in to his plan, assuming they get a chance to have a say.\n     \n            The New York Times and others reported this week that three former Musk employees have taken top positions at the Office of Personnel Management, the formerly obscure HR department for the federal government. It was OPM that first created a government-wide email system and then blasted it with an offer to millions of federal workers giving them the option to resign with pay until September. The offer caught federal workers off guard and unions and government watchdogs have said it is illegal.\n     \nRelated article\nElon Musk spent more than $290 million on the 2024 election, year-end FEC filings show\n \n            OPM confirmed to me that Amanda Scales, who used to work for Musk\u2019s AI company xAI, is now chief of staff at OPM. Brian Bjelde, whose Linkedin profile still lists him as a SpaceX employee, is now a senior director, and so is Anthony Armstrong, a banker who worked with Musk to take over Twitter.\n     \n            The New York Times report included other Musk allies in positions at other agencies, including the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate. Despite encouraging workers to return to the office, Musk also sees getting rid of government real estate or leases, and dispersing remaining workers throughout the country, as a cost saving technique.\n     \n            Trump has twice referred to federal workers being fired if they\u2019re not in offices after a February 6 deadline. \u201cIf they don\u2019t agree by February 6 to show up back to work in their office, they will be terminated,\u201d he said during a speech at the White House this week. There\u2019s nothing in the resignation offer about people actively being fired in the near term.\n     \nWired reported he\u2019s told friends he is sleeping at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds. CNN has not confirmed the report, although it is similar to the story he told about his early days at Twitter and Tesla, when he proved his devotion to employees by sleeping at the office or on the factory floor. It\u2019s either the ultimate commitment to working from home or the ultimate commitment to his job.\n     \n            One outstanding question: Has he taken an oath, like the federal workers he apparently has plans to fire, to uphold the Constitution?\n     \n            I asked Walter Shaub, the former Director of the Office of Government Ethics, who has raised warnings about Trump but also criticized Democrats, about the opacity of Musk\u2019s role and why it should concern Americans.\n     \n            \u201cThe Trump administration owes the American people a detailed explanation as to precisely how it hopes to manage conflicts of interest, as well as whether it deems Musk and each of the other participants in DOGE as a volunteer, a special government employee or a regular government employee,\u201d he said in an email.\n     \n            That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s nominees to lead agencies have to undergo nomination hearings on Capitol Hill and why top officials are supposed to file paperwork with the Office of Government Ethics disclosing their financial interests and pledging to act ethically.\n     \n            They\u2019re supposed to know how their government is spending money and who is doing the spending. The mass resignation offer that caught everyone off guard was made under authority granted to the OPM director. Trump\u2019s nominee, the venture capitalist Scott Kupor, has not yet been confirmed, so the agency is operating with an acting director.\n     \n            Musk laid out some ideas in the Wall Street Journal, back in November when he was working with Vivek Ramaswamy, who has left DOGE.\n     \nMass firings? That plan presaged an effort to encourage workers to resign. What comes next, according to that Journal plan, is they will \u201cidentify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,\u201d after which Trump could suspend worker protections to enforce a \u201cmass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\u201d One wonders how many air traffic controllers is the minimum number required.\n     \nSteep spending cuts? They\u2019re hoping to grab new power, with help from the Supreme Court, for the president to simply ignore Congress and not spend money, something called impoundment. They also wanted to cut $500 billion in spending by targeting things like public broadcasting and foreign aid. There\u2019s already evidence of this plan in Trump\u2019s since-rescinded order to halt federal grants.\n     \nA hard look at Medicare? Some of the efforts should be welcome to Americans, like a long overdue examination of federal contracting and procurement. But don\u2019t be surprised when it takes a hard look at Medicare spending, despite Trump\u2019s pledge not to cut safety net spending. It\u2019s all written out in the Journal.\n     \n            What\u2019s not written is a public plan or a list of Musk allies now in the government. That is something everyone should want to take a look at.\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n \n            Dear readers: Boy was I wrong.\n     \n            Back in August, as speculation about a potential Elon Musk cabinet position began swirling, I wrote that the notion was laughable because a) you can\u2019t work on government matters that affect your own personal finances, so Musk would wind up in a quagmire of lawsuits, and b) even if you ignore the legal and ethical constraints, his Tesla shareholders \u2014 who hold the key to his wealth \u2014 would revolt.\n     \n            I\u2019m here to apologize. Because things got so much wilder than I could have imagined.\n     \n            To be clear: It\u2019s not that I was wrong about the conflicts of interest Musk would be subject to \u2014 there is virtually nothing in government that doesn\u2019t affect Musk\u2019s businesses, which span electric vehicles, robotics, artificial intelligence, space exploration, social media, biotech, satellite comms and road infrastructure.\n     \n            But I sorely underestimated how ferociously Musk would sink his teeth into Donald Trump\u2019s coattails in order to run roughshod over legal precedent and anoint himself the technoking of the federal government.\n     \nRelated article\nHow Elon Musk set off two weeks of chaos across Washington\n \n            Technically, the administration has classified Musk as a \u201cspecial government employee.\u201d And technically, that means he should be subject to federal conflict of interest rules. But technically those statutes have to be enforced by the Justice Department, and it\u2019s yet to be seen whether that will happen. Which is all to say, Tesla shareholders shouldn\u2019t lose any sleep over that one.\n     \n            Over the summer, with the presidential race in a virtual dead heat, some Tesla investors saw the idea of Trump and Musk in the White House as a \u201cdisaster scenario\u201d because they wanted Musk \u2014 whose extracurriculars have long irked shareholders \u2014 focused on his winning horse, the electric vehicle maker built on a promise of a driverless utopia. But since Trump\u2019s decisive win and elevation of \u201cfirst buddy\u201d Musk, shareholders seem content to let Musk run wild on the hopes that he\u2019ll do what any CEO with a scary amount of power would do: slash regulations and make sure any new policies benefit the bottom line.\n     \n            \u201cA formal cabinet position would have been the game-changer, because it would have changed his CEO role,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, told me Tuesday. The current situation is different, he noted, and \u201cany blowback or criticism is far outweighed by these huge positives of Musk\u2019s role in a Trump White House that ultimately will accelerate the autonomous roadmap in the United States.\u201d\n     \n            (Autonomous driving, that is \u2014 just one several of Musk\u2019s projects that he has repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered on.\n     \n            Ultimately, without any enforcement of conflict of interest laws, Musk\u2019s ascension is effectively a cash grab.\n     \n            The chaotic Trump agenda that Musk is abetting has sent businesses scrambling. But not Musk\u2019s businesses.\n     \n            US automakers in particular have been dreading the potential 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian parts that would force American car prices higher. But Tesla didn\u2019t need to sweat those restrictions nearly as much as Ford, GM and Stellantis. That\u2019s because while there\u2019s no such thing as a fully \u201call-American\u201d car, as my colleague Chris Isidore notes, Tesla makes one of the few vehicles that is more American-made than most: the Model 3. That means any future tariffs on Mexico and Canada might not pose the same kind of burden on Tesla as its larger rivals.\n     \n            Trump\u2019s cancellation of EV tax credits, which Musk supported, could still hurt Tesla, of course. But it will almost certainly hurt Tesla\u2019s domestic rivals more.\n \n            And then there\u2019s SpaceX, Musk\u2019s privately owned rocket company, which has become a critical supplier to America\u2019s national space ecosystem. The company has received at least $15 billion in federal contracts over the past decade. And it seems rather unlikely that any of those agreements will be undone by the DOGE bros who claim to be sniffing out wasteful expenses from the federal budget.\n     \nBottom line: I\u2019ve learned my lesson about predicting the future. But we can look at Musk\u2019s recent history for a sense of where all of this is going.\n     \n            Buying Twitter in 2022 was, by traditional metrics, a financial disaster. He killed the platform\u2019s brand, both literally and spiritually, by renaming it X, welcoming neo-Nazi accounts and ultimately tanking its value by an estimated 80%. But in the end, $44 billion turned out to be a small price to pay for what Musk ultimately got: a political megaphone he could deploy to help elect a president willing to let the wannabe tech oligarch have control over the federal government\u2019s infrastructure.\n     \n            Now, under the umbrella of DOGE, Musk has an opportunity to expand and protect his business empire with virtually no restraint. President Trump on Monday sought to reassure folks that \u201cElon can\u2019t do, and won\u2019t do, anything without our approval.\u201d But so far, at least, Musk hasn\u2019t reached the end of his leash.\n     \n            My August headline read, \u201cLet\u2019s throw cold water on the Musk working for Trump thing.\u201d And in some sense, I stand by that.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n \n            It\u2019s one of the more obviously flawed ideas embraced by both President Donald Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk: that government should be run like a business.\n     \n            Synergies! Streamlining! Above all, efficiency \u2014 that is the operative word that will help transform the federal government from a hulking, bloated bureaucracy into a nimble machine, like swapping a 1995 Compaq desktop PC for a 2025 MacBook Pro.\n     \n            Of course, Trump and Musk are applying a business playbook to a thing that is decidedly not a business. Governments don\u2019t work for profit, and the services they provide aren\u2019t supposed to wow shareholders or go viral on TikTok. Good government should fade into the background, unnoticed, so that Americans don\u2019t have to think twice about whether it\u2019s safe to get on a commercial flight or drink water from their tap.\n     \n            That\u2019s not to say government agencies are perfectly calibrated. But not all redundancies can be written off as needless red tape. A leading commission on aviation safety, for one, was widely seen as an asset in bringing the sprawling US industry into alignment. Trump disbanded it last week.\n     \n            Less than two weeks in, and it\u2019s clear Trump is running the White House with the same dictatorial energy he brought to his companies \u2014 almost all of which have been privately held, with no outside board or public shareholders to cater to. It\u2019s a style that also seems to suit Musk, who oversees half a dozen private companies and one public entity, Tesla (where he has stacked his board with loyalists and where he has regularly butted heads with shareholders).\n     \n            In the name of efficiency, the president and Musk are putting on a familiar show of cleaning house \u2014 a tactic so clearly modeled after Musk\u2019s past endeavors, they didn\u2019t even bother to change the subject line. \n \n            On Day One, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, who had publicly clashed with Musk over issues related to SpaceX, stepped down. The post remained vacant for nine days. It was only after 67 people were killed in a midair collision over the Potomac River in Washington that Trump announced the appointment of Chris Rocheleau, an FAA veteran who most recently ran an aviation business lobby, to lead the agency.\n     \n            On his second day in office, Trump fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration and Coast Guard, cutting both their terms short.\n     \nRelated article\nUS airlines\u2019 16-year safety record ended with tragedy. There were warnings ahead of the crash\n \n            On Day Three, all members of a crucial aviation safety committee received a memo, per the AP, saying that the Department of Homeland Security was terminating the group as part of its \u201ccommitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security.\u201d (The advisory, by the way, was ordered by Congress more than 30 years ago in response to the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, and brought together key groups in the aviation industry to advise the TSA on the most effective safety protocols.)\n     \n            Day Seven, trillions in federal funding were frozen indefinitely. Day Eight, the US government did a carbon copy of Musk\u2019s Twitter playbook when it emailed 2 million federal workers with an offer to resign \u2014 once again sparking confusion and panic.\n     \n            Among those 2 million workers were some 11,500 air-traffic controllers who have been stretched thin for years, often working overtime and battling burnout. Last year, the FAA said it was still short 3,000 controllers, despite a surge in hiring.\n     \n            Ten days in, and the sturdy bureaucracy \u2014 the folks tasked with keeping planes in the air, ensuring water is drinkable, providing housing to veterans, any number of other essential services \u2014 is in chaos.\n     \n            And while the cause of the plane crash, just a few miles from the White House near Reagan National Airport, is not yet known, it is testing the new administration\u2019s response to a crisis at its own doorstep.\n     \n            Unsurprisingly, Trump defaulted to a well-worn page of the playbook, heaping blame on his predecessors and suggesting that diversity initiatives eroded aviation standards \u2014 a statement that is just not true and, as usual, he offered no evidence. Neither did Vice President JD Vance, or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, or Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who all parroted the boss.\n     \n            Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are trying to do their jobs while weighing the offer to simply reply to an email with \u201cresign\u201d and walk away. The offer purports to allow workers to leave with eight months of pay and benefits, though many questioned whether the offer was genuine or even legal.\n     \n            That anguish appears to be part of the plan.\n     \n            Russ Vought, Trump\u2019s acting head of the Office of Management and Budget, has stated plainly in private speeches revealed by ProPublica last year that \u201cwe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cWhen they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down\u2026 We want to put them in trauma.\u201d\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "Summary": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\u00a0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n \n            Seven years after SpaceX launched Elon Musk\u2019s cherry red sports car into orbit around our sun, astronomers unwittingly began paying attention to its movements once again.\n     \n            Observers spotted and correctly identified the vehicle as it started its extraterrestrial excursion in February 2018 \u2014 after it had blasted off into space during the Falcon Heavy rocket\u2019s splashy maiden launch. But more recently, the car spawned a high-profile case of mistaken identity as space observers mistook it for an asteroid.\n     \nRelated article\nWhy sonic booms from the most powerful rocket ever built have some scientists worried\n \n            Several observations of the vehicle, gathered by sweeping surveys of the night sky, were inadvertently stashed away in a database meant for miscellaneous and unknown objects, according to the International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Center.\n     \n            An amateur astronomer noticed a string of data points in January that appeared to fit together, describing the orbit of a relatively small object that was swooping between the orbital paths of Earth and Mars.\n     \n            The citizen scientist assumed the mystery object was an undocumented asteroid and promptly sent his findings to the MPC, which operates at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a clearinghouse that seeks to catalog all known asteroids, comets and other small celestial bodies. An astronomer there verified the finding.\n     \n            And thus, the Minor Planet Center logged a new object, asteroid \u201c2018 CN41.\u201d\n     \n            Within 24 hours, however, the center retracted the designation.\n     \n            The person who originally flagged the object realized their own error, MPC astronomer Peter Veres told CNN, noticing that they had, in fact, found several uncorrelated observations of Musk\u2019s car. And the center\u2019s systems hadn\u2019t caught the error.\n     \n            \u201c(The amateur astronomer) was correct. (The data points) really did belong together,\u201d said Veres, who created the database entry for 2018 CN41. \u201cBut again, we just receive the numbers \u2014 the positions, and even the astronomers (using) telescopes, they just see a dot that is moving.\n     \n            \u201cSo from that perspective, if you don\u2019t know up front it\u2019s a Tesla Roadster, there is no way to tell,\u201d Veres added.\n     \n            It was a remarkable case of mistaken identity. But it was far from the first, as a host of similar cases have troubled astronomers. The mix-ups highlight difficulties with tracking objects in deep space \u2014 a problem exacerbated by the growing number of human-made objects getting jettisoned into the ether.\n     \n            Objects traversing our solar system have been misidentified several times in recent years, NASA\u2019s Paul Chodas recalled to CNN. Chodas is director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n     \n            Space experts had mistaken a rocket body on a collision course with the moon for a SpaceX launch vehicle before it was confirmed in 2022 to be a rocket booster from one of China\u2019s past lunar missions.\n     \n            A piece of the Apollo 12 mission\u2019s Saturn V rocket, which carried three astronauts on the second crewed moon landing in 1969, baffled scientists in the early 2000s when it came back into Earth\u2019s orbit. Astronomers had to closely inspect the discarded hardware\u2019s bizarre trajectory to make an accurate identification.\n     \n            The University of Hawaii\u2019s Pan-STARRS1 telescope spotted another rocket part in 2020 that helped launch NASA\u2019s doomed Surveyor 2 lunar probe in 1966 during the height of the 20th century space race. The detection confounded researchers until the US government ordered a \u201chigh-level inter-agency\u201d effort to figure out what the object was, Chodas said.\n     \n            Interest, and sometimes urgency, in understanding and tracking deep-space objects stems from a desire to fundamentally understand the workings of the cosmos as well as helping policymakers and scientists understand threats \u2014 whether those threats are asteroids or foreign adversaries.\n     \n            Musk\u2019s sports car managed to sneak back up on the professionals charged with tracking objects in our solar system for several reasons.\n     \n            One key factor: Experts haven\u2019t been all that interested in keeping tabs on the vehicle.\n     \n            The car is not on a voyage of scientific pursuits. It was sent to space as a piece of deadweight on the inaugural test flight of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket, and the vehicle is now destined to spend eternity soaring aimlessly through our cosmic neighborhood.\n \n            The car has an extremely small chance of ever impacting Earth. So as far as astronomers are concerned, it\u2019s just a hefty piece of space junk.\n     \n            Still, mistaking a spacecraft or human-made object for an asteroid is troublesome for the Minor Planet Center, which is tasked only with identifying naturally occurring objects.\n     \n            \u201cWe don\u2019t want to receive (data about) any artificial objects at all,\u201d Veres said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically wasted time for us,\u201d he added, referring to the MPC.\n     \n            The center is working with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to better integrate data from the agency\u2019s Horizons System database, which keeps close tabs on space rocks\u2019 trajectories and flags potentially dangerous asteroids.\n     \nRelated article\nA newly discovered asteroid has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032\n \n            Veres said he wrote code that aims to better scan for human-made objects that may slip through the Minor Planet Center\u2019s filters by cross-checking with the NASA Horizons database. The fix was implemented this week, Chodas said.\n     \n            If that adjustment had been made earlier, he added, the patch almost certainly would have caught the error.\n     \n            Still, Veres added, updating code is not a catchall solution.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s still not bulletproof,\u201d he said, \u201cand the issue is the number of new launches of spacecrafts.\u201d\n     \n            Today, the world of spaceflight is driven as much by the commercial industry as it is by government agencies such as NASA, he noted. And private companies are not always transparent about exactly where the objects they send to space are going. It\u2019s a problem exacerbated by the fact that companies are launching far more frequently than government space programs ever have.\n     \n            SpaceX, for example, launched nearly 140 rockets   in 2024 alone \u2014 more than NASA launched during the entire 30-year Space Shuttle program.\n     \n            The problem is not just satellites and spacecraft, Veres noted, but the rocket parts that are occasionally flung out into the abyss after they finish a mission.\n     \n            While both JPL and MPC focus squarely on cataloging and tracking natural asteroids, comets and other natural bodies \u2014 the day will come when astronomers must begin closely watching human-made objects in deep space as well, Veres said.\n     \nRelated article\nThe most powerful rocket ever built exploded over a populated island. Residents are still dealing with the fallout\n \n            Right now, Chodas estimates there are about 100 human-made objects in orbit around the sun, and \u201cmost of (those objects) are lost because they\u2019re not tracked much,\u201d he said.\n     \n            \u201cThe bottom line is this: There\u2019s not a reliable database of orbits of these objects around the sun,\u201d Chodas added.\n     \n            That lack of data could be a problem, as the increased traffic could muddy astronomers\u2019 view of space and complicate the work of tracking asteroids that could strike Earth.\n     \n            \u201cI think this topic will become more urgent in upcoming years,\u201d Veres added.\n     \n            One case in point: AstroForge is a bold startup based in Huntington Beach, California, that aims to one day mine rare metals in deep space. The company plans to launch a small spacecraft, called Odin, in late February to fly by an asteroid and snap images to investigate its surface.\n     \n            The mission marks one of the first times a private company has sent a spacecraft into deep space, or beyond the moon.\n     \n            At first, the company declined to publicly say which asteroid it would target, leaving open the possibility that observatories could unwittingly spot the spacecraft. AstroForge relented after pushback from the astronomy community, acknowledging in January that it aimed to send the vehicle to an asteroid called 2022 OB5 \u2014 a relatively small space rock that will pass less than 500,000 miles (800,000 kilometers) from Earth next year.\n     \n            But the company\u2019s CEO, Matthew Gialich, told CNN that things could change. \u201cOne of the best things we have as a company is we can change targets at any time \u2026 so it\u2019s not a huge deal to me to say this one,\u201d he said.\n     \n            \u201cNow, when we find this mythical asteroid that\u2019s purely platinum and is worth $1 trillion in actual material \u2014 am I going to tell the world which one it is?\u201d Gialich said, \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n     \n            The president of the American Astronomical Society, Dara Norman, published a letter in September calling for better transparency among space operators. The document was a call to action for the global space community to come together to increase mutual understanding, highlighting several major concerns.\n     \n            The issues include how government-funded surveys of the night sky can be restricted because of national security concerns, the reality that commercial space companies aren\u2019t always transparent, and the general lack of regulation.\n     \n            In an interview with CNN on Friday, Norman said she believes the AAS put out that call as policy drivers the world over are just beginning to consider these issues.\n     \n            \u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do is work in cooperation with those commercial entities to be able to make sure that science isn\u2019t impacted in some of the most egregious ways,\u201d Norman said. \u201cIf we\u2019re confused about whether something is an unknown asteroid or a Tesla Roadster, then it starts to cost us money to do things like tracking it or figuring it out.\u201d\n     \nRelated article\nWhat is \u2018Kessler Syndrome\u2019 \u2014 and why do some scientists think the space disaster scenario has already started?\n \n            That\u2019s why better coordination and transparency are crucial, Norman said, so that scientists can efficiently do their jobs \u2014 tracking potentially hazardous asteroids and attempting to gain a fuller picture of the objects that populate our solar system.\n     \n            \u201cAs we start to have more players on the global scene,\u201d Norman added, \u201cit\u2019s going to become even more important that we all are transparent with each other.\u201d\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

        "Summary": "After nearly three weeks in the minority, Democrats have finally settled on a target to rally against: Elon Musk.\n     \n            The party and allied groups this week have shown up at the doors of agencies impacted by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, held rallies and press conferences calling the president\u2019s ally an \u201cunelected billionaire,\u201d and introduced legislation to push back on the administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate agencies and force out federal employees.\n     \n            The coordinated effort comes after weeks of Democrats grappling with how to oppose the new administration after a bruising election in which President Donald Trump made gains with key parts of the Democratic base and Republicans flipped the Senate and held the House.\n     \n            For Democrats, Musk has become both an ideal boogeyman and the face of billionaire influence in the Trump administration.\n     \nRelated article\nHow Elon Musk set off two weeks of chaos across Washington\n \n            A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 53% of voters disapproved of Musk playing a prominent role in the administration, including 90% of Democrats, 56% of independents and 19% of Republicans.\n     \n            In the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Democrats mockingly referred to Musk as the president after he helped torpedo a bipartisan spending package while President Joe Biden warned of the \u201cdangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people\u201d and the beginnings of an oligarchy in the United States. Democrats have also noted that the Tesla CEO \u2013 who spent $290 million boosting Trump and other Republicans in the 2024 election \u2013 was given a prime seat at the inauguration, along with other billionaires such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n     \n            Now, after less than three weeks, Musk\u2019s aggressive approach to scaling back the federal government has given Democrats the showdown they have been seeking.\n     \n            \u201cThis fight isn\u2019t just about USAID or the Department of Education, it\u2019s about whether the people and their elected representatives should govern, or whether the richest man in the world gets to call all the shots,\u201d Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThis is exactly the fight the Democrats need to pick to win back undecided voters.\u201d\n     \n            Democrats had been \u201csluggish\u201d in their response to Trump until this week, said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the grassroots Indivisible Project.\n     \n            \u201cOur ask for Democrats right now is, if this is a crisis, you should act like it\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe have to do things to make clear that this is absolutely not normal.\u201d\n     \n            Democratic lawmakers, liberal groups and watchdog organizations have condemned Musk\u2019s efforts to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development and reduce the size of the government by offering to pay federal workers who agree to quit through September as part of a deal Congress has not authorized. They have also railed against access by Musk\u2019s associates to the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system, which disburses funding on behalf of the federal government.\n     \nRelated article\nUSAID employees around the world will be placed on leave Friday and ordered to return to US\n \n            Critics of Musk\u2019s efforts have warned that DOGE workers now have access to the private financial data of millions of Americans and could interfere with key federal payments, including tax refunds and Social Security checks. Many have decried the lack of congressional oversight into its work, arguing that Musk and his allies could be misusing the data they have accessed.\n     \n            \u201cIs he using his access to extraordinary amounts of confidential and sensitive data to advantage his own personal interests? We don\u2019t know,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe have no reason to presume good faith on the part of any of these people because they are simultaneously working to remove every possible check or balance that could assure us that this is above board.\u201d\n     \n            Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has long criticized the role billionaires play in US politics, said that he was most concerned by the administration\u2019s efforts to gut programs unilaterally, which he said was \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cThe president wants to shut down USAID? He can have one of his Republican friends introduce legislation to do that, and it will be debated,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt will not pass, but will be debated. He does not have the unilateral power, especially through an unelected official like Mr. Musk.\u201d\n     \n            A House Oversight Committee vote to subpoena Musk, led by Democrats, was blocked by Republicans Wednesday.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s letting a small group of unelected people, secret, run rampant through the executive branch accessing the private data millions of Americans need, and God knows what they\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said of DOGE Tuesday.\n     \n            Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday introduced the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d Act, legislation aimed at DOGE and Musk that would \u201cprevent unlawful meddling in the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems and protect Americans across the country,\u201d Schumer said.\n     \n            Administration officials have said DOGE workers have \u201cread-only\u201d access to the data. A White House official said Musk and his team are working \u201cin full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.\u201d\n     \nRelated article\nTreasury says Musk\u2019s DOGE has not rejected payments in first attempt to clarify access granted to critical system\n \n            \u201cThe ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change,\u201d the official said in a statement.\n     \n            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that Musk would recuse himself in areas where he has conflicts of interest. She added that Trump was elected with a mandate to make the government more efficient.\n     \n            \u201cHe campaigned across the country with Elon Musk, vowing that Elon was going to head up the Department of Government Efficiency and the two of them, with a great team around them, were going to look at the receipts of this federal government and ensure it\u2019s accountable to American taxpayers,\u201d Leavitt said.\n     \n            Other Republicans have pushed back on Democrats\u2019 framing. In response to Democrats\u2019 rallying cry that \u201cNo one voted for Elon Musk,\u201d Vice President JD Vance wrote on X that: \u201cThey did however vote for Donald Trump who promised repeatedly to have Elon Musk root out wasteful spending in our government.\u201d\n     \n            For some Democrats, particularly those in GOP-leaning districts, Musk serves as a foil in ways the president can\u2019t.\n     \n            \u201cMy constituents, and a majority of this country, put Trump in the White House, not this unelected, weirdo billionaire,\u201d Rep. Jared Golden of Maine \u2013 one of about a dozen Democrats in a seat Trump won \u2013 wrote on Musk\u2019s site X. \u201cMusk is stepping on the president\u2019s toes \u2014 making decisions without his approval, pursuing his own agenda. If I had an employee that sidelined me the way Musk is sidelining Trump, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d just sit back and take it.\u201d\n     \n            Pat Dennis, the president of the American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC focused on \u201copposition research\u201d into Republicans, said that while Trump is still the prime motivator, Musk seemed poised to cause damage to the administration.\n     \n            \u201cMusk is acting like you essentially gave Paul Ryan a whole bunch of stimulants and then set him loose in the government,\u201d said Dennis, referring to the former House speaker and deficit hawk. \u201cThis is a level of cost-cutting with no regard for the impact on everyday people, that Trump allegedly set himself in opposition to.\u201d\n     \n            An advisor to multiple Democratic donors told CNN that Democrats should continue to focus on Musk.\n     \n            \u201cWe need to be going to places and say, \u2018Elon Musk now has your Social Security number,\u2019\u201d the advisor said.\n     \n            They acknowledged, however, that Democratic elected officials are still absorbing the rapidly unfolding moves of the new Trump administration. While Democrats envisioned a range of scenarios for the first 100 days of the Trump administration, \u201cElon Musk taking over the government payment systems was not on the bingo card,\u201d the person said.\n     \n            \u201cIt has only been two weeks, and it\u2019s worse than we thought,\u201d they added.\n     \n            Organized labor is attempting to zero in on Musk\u2019s work as well. The AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s major federation of unions, on Wednesday launched a new campaign billed as \u201cThe Department of People Who Work for a Living\u201d to push back on DOGE\u2019s work.\n     \n            \u201cIf Elon Musk can make up his own government department, so can workers,\u201d Liz Shuler, the president of AFL-CIO, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThis is just unprecedented. We\u2019ve never seen this kind of influence by billionaire CEOs on the norms of our government.\u201d\n     \n            The campaign, which is expected to include digital ads and mailers, will aim to hold Musk \u201caccountable,\u201d Shuler said, and amplify the stories of workers who may be impacted by DOGE\u2019s efforts \u2013 from air traffic controllers that play a key role in the flying public\u2019s safety to mine workers dependent on worker safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n     \n            \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is put a human face right on the fact that these are not just bureaucracies. These are not sleepy, tired, old, outdated, outmoded agencies. These are real people,\u201d Shuler said.\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

        "Summary": "Elon Musk and his allies have spent the last two weeks barreling full speed into multiple government agencies, causing confusion and chaos and raising questions about whether an unelected businessman can wield this kind of authority, seemingly running roughshod over laws and programs set up by Congress.\n     \n            Over the last several days, Musk-aligned personnel have gained full access to the Treasury\u2019s payments system, threatened to shut down the US Agency for International Development, offered all federal employees a sort of \u201cbuyout\u201d plan, and in several agencies, pushed aside career civil servants \u2013 in some cases locking them out of their offices or computers.\n     \n            Taken together, Musk\u2019s moves represent an unprecedented effort to expand the power of the executive branch with little regard for laws or procedures \u2013 an effort Donald Trump foreshadowed during his successful 2024 campaign. Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts, and now, access to the innermost workings of the federal government.\n     \n            \u201cI have a hard time thinking of anyone who has exerted the kind of power and control that he has exerted over government operations in the last week,\u201d Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who specializes in government ethics, told CNN.\n     \n            The question of whether Musk will comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules \u2013 and whether the Trump administration will enforce them \u2013 has drawn scrutiny from Democrats and watchdog groups.\n     \n            Multiple lawsuits are also underway, with more likely to come.\n     \n            Critics accuse Musk and his allies of running afoul of laws aimed at protecting the security of federal data, while seeking to shrink or outright eliminate agencies in moves that would take an act of Congress.\n     \n            After days of silence on the question of Musk\u2019s employment status, the White House on Monday indicated that Musk has been officially serving as a special government employee. That designation means Musk isn\u2019t a volunteer but also not a full-time federal employee.\n     \n            \u201cSpecial government employees are sort of like super-volunteers. They\u2019re more empowered but less encumbered,\u201d said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of the National Security Counselors, which represents federal employees and whistleblowers and has sued the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency in court.\n     \n            A special government employee is a temporary position for someone who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period. Musk isn\u2019t being paid, a person familiar with his employment told CNN.  He does have an office on the White House campus.\n     \n            \u201cElon can\u2019t do and won\u2019t do anything without our approval. And we\u2019ll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won\u2019t,\u201d the president said on Monday.\n     \nRelated article\nElon Musk is serving as a \u2018special government employee,\u2019 White House says\n \n            As a special government employee, Musk is covered by a federal conflicts-of-interest statute that prohibits government employees from participating in matters that would affect their financial interests. That law can be enforced criminally or in the civil context, but it only by the Justice Department \u2013 in this case, Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n     \n            It is unclear whether Musk has formally been appointed the administrator of the US DOGE entity created by a January 20 Trump executive order. The White House press office hasn\u2019t responded to multiple CNN emails seeking that clarification.\n     \n            Such an appointment would weigh on whether Musk is obligated under ethics rules to publicly file a financial disclosure form, said Clark. Also relevant to that determination is whether previous occupants of the administrator role \u2013 at the DOGE predecessor agency, the US Digital Service \u2013 were highly ranked enough in government service to fall under a mandated public release of the disclosure form.\n     \n            The status of the other DOGE appointees dispersed to federal agencies is also unclear, even to staffers at the agencies. Some are now officially in employee databases and have government emails. Others have been entering agencies under visitor badges. Some staffers have reported having meetings with personnel who identify themselves as part of the political appointee team. WIRED has reported that some of the staffers brought on with political appointees at the Office of Personnel Management appear to be in their early 20s.\n     \n            OPM, the closest equivalent to the federal government\u2019s human resources agency, has been the source of mass emails being sent to all federal employees in recent days urging them to resign and be paid through September. The emails\u2019 subject line \u2013 \u201cA fork in the road\u201d \u2013 matched one that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Musk bought the company.\n     \nRelated article\nFederal employees confused, angered by Trump\u2019s offer to quit\n \n            And now the agency that has been trying to encourage mass resignations of federal employees is itself on the chopping block. On Monday, senior staff at OPM had to identify 30% of their workforce they could cut in the near term, with a floated goal of an eventual 70% reduction in staff, according to two sources. Those cuts could significantly impact OPM\u2019s ability to perform its tasks, including benefits, services and oversight.\n     \n            When asked for comment on Friday, an unnamed official replied from OPM\u2019s media relations office with a short email broadly denying CNN\u2019s reporting. The agency didn\u2019t respond when asked follow-up questions or for more specifics.\n     \n            Musk himself has made several visits to the OPM offices in downtown Washington, DC, sources said. But most alarming for the career civil servants at OPM, multiple sources told CNN, is that the political appointees have cut off nearly all the senior-level career civil servants at the agency.\n     \n            Career civil servants at OPM, including those at the senior-most levels, have been physically moved out of their offices in the Office of the Director Annex and onto different floors. Some have also lost access to internal data systems. That has raised many alarms for civil servants concerned that the personal data, including Social Security numbers, of millions of federal employees is at risk.\n     \n            \u201cThe political team has unfettered access to everything the Office of the Chief Information Officer manages,\u201d a source at the agency told CNN. \u201cMany of the appointees are software engineers who are making back-end changes without regard to federal norms and requirements. They are pulling statutorily required information off OPM.gov.\u201d\n     \n            The agency has had strict cybersecurity protocols in place since a 2015 hack of OPM, which compromised sensitive personal information of roughly 21.5 million people from both inside and outside the government. The hack, which US officials have blamed on Chinese spies, forced OPM and other federal agencies to overhaul their cyber defenses.\n     \n            The agency now faces a lawsuit, brought by McClanahan\u2019s firm on behalf of two anonymous federal employees, accusing the administration of failing to conduct a required data security assessment when setting up an OPM email distribution system for mass emails to the entire federal civil service.\n     \n            Some of Musk\u2019s top lieutenants have been working directly at OPM or advising at the agency since the inauguration. They include Steve Davis, the CEO of the Boring Company who helped Musk during the purge of Twitter staffers in 2022, as well as now OPM senior adviser Brian Bjelde, who had been vice president of people operations at SpaceX, and Amanda Scales, now OPM\u2019s chief of staff who until January worked in talent at Musk\u2019s xAI company.\n     \n            Trump\u2019s nominee to run OPM, Scott Kupor, who is awaiting confirmation, also holds deep ties to the Silicon Valley universe integral to Musk\u2019s DOGE operations. Kupor comes from Andreessen Horowitz, the powerhouse tech venture capital shop co-founded by Marc Andreessen. Andreessen, a legend in the tech space, was closely involved in advising Trump\u2019s transition operation.\n     \n            The appointed acting director of the agency \u2013 Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Ezell \u2013 was until January, an OPM branch chief for data analytics in Georgia, a jump in seniority that shocked current and former OPM staff.\n     \n            Shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, top career staffers at USAID \u2013 which Musk has branded a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that should \u201cdie\u201d \u2013 were placed on immediate leave. The entire executive team and every deputy in the agency, which dispenses billions in humanitarian aid and development funding annually, were suddenly gone.\n     \n            According to sources, personnel from the Musk-created office then physically tried to access the USAID headquarters in Washington, DC, and were stopped. The DOGE personnel demanded to be let in and threatened to call US Marshals to be allowed access, two of the sources said.\n     \n            The DOGE personnel wanted to gain access to USAID security systems and personnel files, three sources said. Two of those sources also said the DOGE personnel wanted access to classified information, which only those with security clearances and a specific need to know are able to access. Eventually they were able to access the headquarters.\n     \n            On Sunday night, Musk said Trump had agreed the agency should be shut down. By Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was now acting administrator of USAID. Its website was offline and remaining staff were told to work from home.\n     \n            But critics have argued that Trump can\u2019t unilaterally abolish USAID, whose existence is written into federal law and whose budget comes from congressional appropriations.\n     \n            \u201cThe president has zero legal authority to \u2018shut down,\u2019 defund, or otherwise cripple a $50 billion agency. Audit it, identify unnecessary expenditures, draft reform or rescission proposals, and then go to Congress to PASS A LAW,\u201d Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote on X.\n     \n            A quiet but similarly consequential Musk-driven mission has been underway at the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate and procurement.\n     \n            The same day Trump took the oath of office, GSA employees received an email from the newly appointed acting head of the agency that highlighted the need for GSA to commit itself to \u201censuring government-wide efficiency and maximizing value for the American taxpayer,\u201d according to a copy read to CNN.\n     \n            Trump political appointees at GSA asked career employees to look into purchasing mattresses, washers and dryers in order to extend working hours in the building, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n     \n            One source said the new equipment was so political appointees could \u201cwork around the clock.\u201d The source added that the political appointees also wanted to extend the idea of sleeping in the federal building to career staff, but they faced internal push back. They were told that \u201cthey could not make career employees sleep in the federal building,\u201d the source said.\n     \n            A DOGE spokesperson suggested to CNN that it was not true that political appointees had requested mattresses, washers and dryers be purchased for the GSA building. Musk himself has touted bringing mattresses in for DOGE employees. He\u2019s also bragged that DOGE employees are working 120-hour weeks, just as employees have at his private companies.\n     \n            Stephen Ehikian, a former Salesforce executive who most recently worked in AI, was tapped to serve as the agency\u2019s deputy administrator and has taken on the role of acting head of GSA until a Trump nominee is confirmed for the role. The efficiency mandate, Ehikian wrote, was \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\n     \n            Ehikian\u2019s email also served as the internal announcement of a series of new appointees across key roles in the agency. They include Thomas Shedd, who is taking over the leadership of the Technology Transformation Services, the essential government unit for the government\u2019s technology products and services.\n     \n            Shedd spent the previous eight years building software for vehicle and battery factories at Tesla, Musk\u2019s car company. His approach in the new role carries echoes of Musk\u2019s private-sector strategies, one of the people familiar with the matter said, citing a Shedd email this week to hundreds of GSA employees to schedule \u201ctouch-base\u201d sessions and bring with them an example of a recent \u201ctechnical win.\u201d\n     \n            In addition to managing the federal government\u2019s real estate, GSA manages some of the most massive government contracts.\n     \n            Critics have questioned the inherent conflict of interest in Musk\u2019s associates working within the GSA, even though they all should have signed nondisclosure agreements. Musk has billions of dollars in government contracts, and one source familiar with the situation noted that some of his closest associates now have access to \u201csensitive and often classified acquisitions information for billions of dollars in government contracts.\u201d\n     \n            According to two sources familiar with the situation at GSA, every office agency must present proposals this week to cut 50% of their business expenses, in addition to the GSA efforts to significantly reduce the federal government\u2019s real estate footprint. GSA is also expected to begin terminating about 3,000 of the \u201csoft term\u201d leases (of nearly 7,000 total leases across the country). Leadership have been advised of a push to cancel 300 leases per day.\n     \n            The GSA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n     \n            Late last week, the DOGE appointees were granted full access to the government\u2019s payments system after the top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left his job unexpectedly. The DOGE appointees had clashed with Lebryk after they expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n     \n            Musk himself acknowledged his interest in the Treasury Department\u2019s payment processing in a middle-of-the-night post on his social media platform Saturday.\n     \n            He wrote his team \u201cdiscovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.\u201d\n     \n            The post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system\u2019s value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation\u2019s economy lies in its reliability.\n     \n            The Treasury moves have spurred a lawsuit, filed Monday on behalf of government unions and others, alleging a \u201cmassive and unprecedented\u201d intrusion into private government data.\n     \n            It adds to a pile of lawsuits that has grown quickly in the last two weeks, in some cases halting the administration\u2019s actions.\n     \n            \u201cThat\u2019s why this whole mishmash is so troubling,\u201d McClanahan said. \u201cThey have managed to break so many rules and so many laws with some fairly simple actions that a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in the media and politicians and everyone get tangled up on. \u2026 You\u2019re basically punching smoke when you\u2019re trying to litigate against this.\u201d\n     \nThis story has been updated with new reporting\n \n            CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Alayna Treene, Jennifer Hansler, Lauren Kent, Alex Marquardt and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.\n     \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

        "Summary": "Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. USAID humanitarian aid destined for Venezuela is displayed for the media at a warehouse next to the Tienditas International Bridge on the outskirts of Cucuta, Colombia, Feb. 19, 2019. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara, File) A man walks past boxes of USAID humanitarian aid at a warehouse at the Tienditas International Bridge on the outskirts of Cucuta, Colombia, Feb. 21, 2019, on the border with Venezuela. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara)     WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Agency for International Development is on the cusp of being shuttered, according the Trump administration\u2019s billionaire adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk \u2014 who has been wrestling for control of the agency in recent days.  Early Monday, Musk held a live session on X Spaces, previously known as Twitter Spaces, and said that he spoke in detail about USAID with the president. \u201cHe agreed we should shut it down,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWhat we have is just a ball of worms. You\u2019ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It\u2019s beyond repair.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d His comments come after the administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk\u2019s government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Members of Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, eventually did gain access Saturday to the aid agency\u2019s classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk\u2019s DOGE crew lacked high enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials \u2014 John Voorhees and deputy Brian McGill \u2014 believed themselves legally obligated to deny access. The current and former U.S. officials had knowledge of the incident and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. \n Musk on Sunday responded to an X post about the news by saying, \u201cUSAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\u201d He followed with additional posts on X about the aid agency.  Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, said in a separate post that no classified material was accessed \u201cwithout proper security clearances.\u201d It comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk\u2019s team accessing sensitive information. Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. \u201cIt\u2019s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we\u2019re getting them out,\u201d Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.  The Trump administration and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID\u2019s humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide \u2014 compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations \u2014 and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency\u2019s leadership and staff in Washington. The U.S. is by far the world\u2019s largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries.  Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump\u2019s first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors badges asking questions of employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk\u2019s DOGE team. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump was allowing Musk to access people\u2019s personal information and shut down government funding.  \u201cWe must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York, Matthew Lee in Panama City and Fatima Hussein in Washington contributed to this report. ___ This story has been updated to correct the surname name of one of the USAID security officials.

The company said Tuesday that Grimace will reunite with his Irish uncle, Uncle O'Grimacey, unretiring the mascot after decades out of the spotlight. McDonald's originally created Uncle O'Grimacey in 1975 to promote the Shamrock Shake, but he hasn't been seen since the mid-1980s. The Shamrock Shake, a seasonal staple for more than 50 years, returns to U.S. restaurants annually before St. Patrick's Day. The milkshake comes back on Feb. 10. This year, 25 cents of every Shamrock Shake sale will go toward the Ronald McDonald House Charities. That same day the shake relaunches, the fast-food giant is expected to report its fourth-quarter results. McDonald's sales have struggled to bounce back since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked its Quarter Pounder burgers to a fatal E. coli outbreak in October, even after the health agency declared the crisis over. A viral moment, like the return of Uncle O'Grimacey, could boost traffic to its restaurants and lift sales out of their slump. Uncle O'Grimacey's reappearance marks the third time since the viral Grimace Birthday Meal that the chain has used its retro mascots in marketing. The company named its beverage-focused spinoff brand CosMc's, after the McDonald's-loving alien that appeared in ads decades ago. And when McDonald's launched its \"Best Burger\" initiative to spread the word about changes to its cheeseburgers and Big Macs, the company sent the Hamburglar on a cross-country tour. But Grimace remains the star. His birthday meal, complete with a purple milkshake, helped McDonald's quarterly U.S. same-store sales climb more than 10% in the spring of 2023. And Grimace has held onto the public's adoration. Last year, he became a good luck charm for the New York Mets during the professional baseball team's most recent season. After Grimace threw out the first pitch before a June game, the Mets went on a winning streak, which led the mascot to appear at games through the team's playoff push. Uncle O'Grimacey disappeared after the company dialed back its use of the McDonaldland mascots. However, a rumor circulated the internet in recent years, saying that Uncle O'Grimacey wasn't used publicly after an actor playing the mascot in Philadelphia made comments in support of the Irish Republican Army; there's no evidence to suggest that the incident actually happened.

In its annual report published on Wednesday, Alphabet excluded language from prior years stating that, \"we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\" Fiona Cicconi, Alphabet's chief people officer, told employees in a memo that the company has to make changes due to new requirements. \"Because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and U.S. Executive Orders on this topic,\" Cicconi wrote in the memo, which was viewed by CNBC. \"We'll continue to invest in states across the U.S. \u2014 and in many countries globally \u2014 but in the future we will no longer have aspirational goals.\" The Wall Street Journal first reported on the memo. Cicconi noted that in 2020, the company set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing offices outside California and New York to improve representation. One of Trump's first acts as president after taking office in January was to sign an executive order ending the government's DEI programs\u00a0and putting federal officials overseeing those initiatives on leave. And following a midair collision\u00a0between an\u00a0American Airlines\u00a0regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter above Washington, D.C., last week, Trump blasted former President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and DEI policies claiming they \"could have been\" to blame for the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001. Tech companies have shown an eagerness to appease the new administration following a rocky four years during Trump's first tenure in the White House. Amazon said earlier in January that it was halting some of its diversity and inclusion initiatives, and Meta announced plans to end a number of\u00a0internal programs\u00a0designed to increase the company's hiring of diverse candidates. Beyond the tech industry, companies including Target, Walmart and McDonald's have made similar changes. Google's\u00a0commitments for 2025 had included increasing the number of people from underrepresented groups in leadership by 30% and more than doubling the number of Black workers at non-senior levels. The company began making cuts to its DEI programs in 2023, CNBC reported at the time, getting rid of staffers who were in charge of recruiting underrepresented groups and letting go of DEI leaders who worked with Chief Diversity Officer Melonie Parker. Parker, who took on her current role in 2019, will work closely on evaluating programs and trainings and update \"those that raise risk, or that aren't as impactful as we'd hoped,\" Cicconi wrote in her memo. She added that the Google's employee resource groups will remain as will the company's work with colleges and universities. A Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company is \"committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we've been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there.\" WATCH: Trump blasts Biden, DEI efforts after D.C. plane crash Got a confidential news tip?

As the Trump administration targets diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, many prominent companies have publicly scaled back or scrapped their programs and goals for metrics such as employee and leadership representation. Others have insisted they will continue to support DEI, opening themselves up to political pressure \u2014 but also financial opportunity. DEI professionals told CNBC that either strategy comes with tricky pros and cons: Brands seen as advocating for DEI could face legal challenges, but they also stand to benefit from the advantages of DEI and the loyalty of customers who share their values. Brands that publicly pull back may avoid the scrutiny of President Donald Trump and his allies, but risk stirring up controversy in an increasingly polarized environment. Some companies, fearful of moving too loudly in either direction, may continue to support DEI internally, experts said, even as they stay silent publicly in order to avoid activist campaigns against them. \"I can't be clear enough: DEI isn't dying. It's evolving,\" said Daisy Auger-Dom\u00ednguez, founder and CEO of workplace consulting firm Auger-Dom\u00ednguez Ventures. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office ending all DEI programs across the federal government. He issued another order a day later demanding the Justice Department identify and potentially sue \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners.\" The White House's hostility toward DEI has elevated the stakes for corporations already grappling with how to navigate the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion amid a growing culture war, experts said. Several companies, such as Lowe's and Ford, had begun rolling back DEI programs even before Trump's election victory in November. In a statement to CNBC, Ford said it was committed to a \"respectful and inclusive workplace for all employees.\" On Nov. 25, Walmart said it was winding down some DEI-related efforts, though in a statement to CNBC this week, the retailer said it is focused on its values of \"respect, integrity, service and excellence.\" In late January, Target issued an internal memo ending several DEI-related goals and partnerships and emphasizing a program centered on \"belonging.\" On Wednesday, Google said it will retire its aspirational hiring targets in light of the executive orders and recent court decisions. A Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement this week it's \"committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities.\" Others, including Caterpillar and 3M, told CNBC they are currently reviewing the executive orders to assess their implications. Citigroup is also analyzing the impact of the orders, a person familiar with the process told CNBC on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal matters. \"What you're seeing right now is people trying to safeguard internally the work that is necessary, because they understand not just the business but the people value of this work,\" Auger-Dom\u00ednguez told CNBC. \"This is not the time to be experimenting with this. This is the time to be doubling down on what's important to your organization,\" she added. Some companies have stood firm on their support for DEI since the executive order. Costco is perhaps the most prominent example: Its board of directors unanimously opposed a proposal by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, for the wholesaler to publish a report on the risks of its DEI policies. Investors defeated the proposal with about 98% voting against it, the company announced at its annual shareholder meeting Jan. 23. \"A welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\" Costco Chairman Hamilton James said at the meeting. Apple is similarly resisting the think tank's proposal for the tech giant to consider abolishing its diversity and inclusion initiatives. The measure will receive a vote at Apple's annual shareholder meeting Feb. 25. \"We strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" Apple's board said in a statement. Several high-profile CEOs including Bill Ready of Pinterest, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs have recently indicated that their businesses will stick with their current approaches to DEI. Both JPMorgan and Goldman are also targets of anti-DEI proposals by the National Center for Public Policy Research. JPMorgan directed a CNBC request for comment to Dimon's 2024 shareholder letter, where he wrote that the company's DEI initiatives \"lead to more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results for us and for the economy overall.\" Goldman Sachs declined to comment to CNBC. Ice cream company Ben & Jerry's, which has long been vocal about social activism, said in a statement to CNBC that it remains committed to supporting equity and justice throughout the company, while also calling out companies that have rolled back DEI commitments made in the wake of George Floyd's murder by police in 2020. \"We believe that companies that timidly bow to the current political climate by attempting to turn back the clock will become increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace and will ultimately be judged as having been on the wrong side of history,\" the company said. Outdoor apparel company Patagonia, which likewise has a history of activism for climate action, also said in a statement to CNBC that it wouldn't be rolling back its DEI policies. \"We stand firm in support of our justice, equity and antiracism policies and practices,\" Patagonia said. Although cosmetics brand E.l.f. Beauty does not have formal DEI programs, it promotes inclusivity in its company culture and has not changed its stance on DEI, CEO Tarang Amin said in written comments to CNBC. \"This isn't about risks or rewards, it's about having a diverse set of views to best serve our community with exceptional products they want, at prices they can afford,\" Amin wrote. Andrew Clarke, CEO of clothing retailer Francesca's, posted a LinkedIn video last week affirming the company's commitment to respect and inclusion. He told CNBC that he sees DEI as having been key to Francesca's rebound after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. \"D&I is not an abbreviation or a mandated deliberate strategy in this organization, it's a human strategy,\" Clarke said. \"The notion of inclusivity, respect and belonging and treating our fellow associates as we would like to be treated ourselves \u2014 that has been awesome for the culture, but also for the turnaround of our business from a financial perspective.\" Clarke cited a senior leadership team composed of 69% women and employee policies such as a flexible dress code as examples of how Francesca's centers inclusivity. Although he said he is mindful of potential legal limitations from recent White House policy, he said the company will continue the strategies that have made it successful. Even if brands are staying silent or rolling back their external goals or messaging, DEI experts told CNBC, they may still be working to promote diversity and inclusion within their companies. Amira Barger, a DEI executive and professor of communications at California State University, East Bay, said businesses' approaches to DEI might look more like they did before 2020, when many companies were quick to issue public statements and launch programs in support of DEI and social justice in the wake of Floyd's murder and the national demonstrations it sparked. DEI programs boost talent retention and consumer loyalty, Barger said, adding she doesn't expect corporations to end them entirely. Researchers have identified relationships between corporate DEI and benefits such as adaptability and financial outperformance. \"I do think we will continue to see companies be less\u00a0vocal, but I think people should take a pause and really ask more questions, because I do think many of these companies are still quietly doing the work behind the scenes,\" Barger said. Some companies have been rebranding and renaming their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Eloiza Domingo, CEO and founder of consulting firm FourTen and former chief DEI officer and vice president for human resources at Allstate, said she's seen an increase in the use of terms such as \"belonging,\" \"cultural competency\" and \"employee engagement\" in place of the typical acronym DEI. As someone who's worked with companies on DEI, Domingo said, she's empathetic toward those companies that are reconsidering their external DEI strategy. She said she's grappling with that issue for her own business, as she works on attracting more clients. \"I'm known as a diversity keynote. I'm known as a changemaker. Now, that is under not only scrutiny but under attack,\" Domingo said. \"And so what do I do as an entrepreneur to keep my business going, but also to feed the kids? That's really, really scary.\" In a Jan. 6 statement titled \"Our Commitment to Inclusion,\" McDonald's announced it was retiring \"aspirational representation goals,\" participation in external DEI surveys, and its supply chain DEI pledge. It also changed its diversity team's name to \"Global Inclusion Team.\" The fast food giant faced immediate backlash, leading to McDonald's Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer Desiree Ralls-Morrison defending the company in a LinkedIn post. Ralls-Morrison asserted that many critics hadn't fully read the statement, which also said that McDonald's had met its targets in areas such as gender pay equity and supplier diversity and that the company was \"proud of our incredible accomplishments in this space and excited to continue our inclusion journey.\" \"McDonald's\u00a0was suggested in the headlines as having killed DEI,\" Barger said. \"It is much more nuanced. I think they strategically rebranded their approach.\" Ralls-Morrison and McDonald's didn't respond to requests for comment. Sina Port, a brand strategist and diversity consultant, said businesses that aren't publicizing their DEI policies can still communicate their support for inclusion to consumers \u2014 without being overly performative or making empty commitments. She cited actions such as promoting the personal brands of diverse employees and creating products that are actually useful to communities, such as sports equipment for people with disabilities. \"In general, I'm not a huge fan of just making announcements to customers. I look more at the action that you're taking,\" Port told CNBC. It's too soon to determine whether companies currently taking stances on DEI will see an impact on their stock or revenue, Barger said, but she expects some consumers will make buying decisions based on the company's values. \"In these moments we're going to be tested in terms of consumer loyalty, every brand,\" Barger said. Activist campaigns targeting specific corporations have had a demonstrable impact in recent years. Backlash against Bud Light's partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023 contributed to a sales slump for the brand that resulted in Bud Light losing its long-held status as the top-selling U.S. beer. Target said a boycott of the retailer over its Pride merchandise that same year hurt its sales. The company had offered Pride merchandise for years prior to the boycott. DEI supporters are hoping to leverage the same influence for their cause. Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, has organized two \"buy-cotts\" at Costco, in which the organization mobilized people to shop at the wholesaler to support its pro-DEI stance. The two events collectively brought in more than 400 shoppers, he told CNBC. Sharpton said NAN is planning more shows of support at Costco and other businesses. The organization is also actively researching companies to boycott for their DEI policy rollbacks, Sharpton said, adding that NAN is specifically looking at corporations that have small profit margins and a significant Black consumer base. The group also plans to buy stock in these companies and submit shareholder proposals. \"We'll support those that support us.\u2029We believe that corporations have the right to decide their policy, but we have the right to decide who we're going to patronize,\" Sharpton said. \u2014 CNBC's Melissa Repko and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

The company filed its report for 2024 on Friday following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The prior annual report included a mention of \"inclusion and diversity\" in a section titled \"Human Capital,\" language that does not appear in the latest filing. The previous report read, \"As we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent.\" Now that section reads, \"We strive to be Earth's best employer,\" and says the company relies on \"numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective.\" The change comes after Amazon recently halted some of its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. Candi Castleberry, Amazon's vice president of inclusive experiences and technology, told employees in a December memo that the company was in the process of \"winding down outdated programs and materials\" as part of a broader review of hundreds of initiatives. Castleberry wrote that the company believes its DEI programs continue to be \"important work.\" She said Amazon will keep investing in certain initiatives, though she didn't specify further.  Amazon also edited a public-facing webpage that states its policy positions to trim its messaging around DEI issues. Previously, there were separate sections dedicated to \"Equity for Black people,\" \"Diversity, equity and inclusion\" and \"LGBTQ+ rights.\" Those sections were all consolidated into a single paragraph, while any mention of the term \"transgender\" was removed. Companies in Silicon Valley and beyond have been moving swiftly away from DEI policies since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Google scrapped language around DEI goals in its annual report, and Meta last month announced it was retreating from internal programs designed to increase its hiring of diverse candidates. McDonald's, Walmart and Target have also ended or changed some programs, while other companies including Disney, GM, GE and Pepsi are removing mentions of DEI in their annual filings, NPR reported. Some companies have steered clear of the backlash against DEI. Costco rejected a shareholder proposal to report on the risks of its DEI policies to its stock price. Apple is also resisting a similar proposal. The CEOs of Pinterest, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have indicated they plan to stand by their DEI policies. Amazon, the nation's second-largest employer behind Walmart, had more than 1.5 million employees as of Dec. 31. In recent years, Amazon had pledged to double the number of Black employees in senior leadership roles and hire 30% more Black people as corporate employees in the U.S. The changes in its approach to DEI come as the company pursues a massive investment in artificial intelligence, which CEO Andy Jassy calls a \u00a0\"once in a lifetime opportunity.\" On its earnings call on Thursday, Amazon\u00a0said it plans to boost its capital expenditures to $100 billion in 2025 with a focus on AI. That is the biggest capex commitment among the megacap tech companies. WATCH: Amazon falls on guidance Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The stock closed at $229.53, exceeding its previous high reached in November, and is now up about 60% over the past year. Fiserv, which went public in 1986, provides digital payments technology to small businesses and financial institutions. Fiserv reported adjusted earnings of $2.51 in the quarter, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $2.48, according to LSEG. Revenue increased about 7% to $5.25 billion from $4.92 billion a year earlier, topping the $4.96 billion consensus estimate. Clover revenue jumped 29% from the year-ago quarter and in the full year, reaching $2.7 billion for all of 2024. The Clover product consists of payments hardware and software, and helps businesses streamline receivables and payables. CEO Frank Bisignano told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" on Wednesday that Clover is a key driver of growth, and said Fiserv's relationships with 3,500 U.S. banks provide an opportunity to deepen market penetration and product offerings. Fiserv completed the $22 billion acquisition of payment processor First Data in 2019. \"The strength of the company is the construction of the company that we built by putting First Data and Fiserv together which others tried, but they then didn't get there,\" Bisignano said. He added that the integration allowed the company to serve small businesses as well as major enterprises such as McDonald's and Walmart, along with nearly every bank in the country. Bisignano was nominated by President Donald Trump to head the Social Security Administration. Fiserv in January named Michael Lyons as its CEO-elect and said he would report to Bisignano, who will keep his current role until June 30 or \"upon an earlier confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\" For 2025, Fiserv expects revenue growth of 10% to 12%. Analysts were calling for growth of about 8%. The company forecast adjusted earnings of $10.10 to $10.30 for 2025, about in line with Wall Street's consensus of $10.21. After the report, Mizuho reaffirmed its buy recommendation, citing Fiserv's distribution network and Clover's outperformance. In a separate report, Mizuho said Fiserv and other payment companies could be beneficiaries of the Trump administration's tariffs due to higher payment processing from rising prices. The Clover business, in particular, stands to benefit, as transaction volumes increase at restaurants and other small businesses, the firm said. Still, analysts noted a few risks to Fiserv's momentum, such as a potential slowdown in new U.S. merchant customers and bank consolidation. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

But this week, she's been posting a steady trickle of content from New Orleans. That's because Austin, 31, from California, is one of hundreds of creators who have swarmed the Big Easy for Super Bowl 59, getting paid large contracts to make social media content for big-name brands like Electronic Arts and Nike. Austin was sent to New Orleans this week by Snap and the NFL to give her fans a behind-the-scenes look at the Super Bowl. She's also involved in integrations around the games with brands like Microsoft and Verizon, for whom she is hosting a promotional fan event. \"I can reach a lot of people myself,\" said Austin, who has about 2 million followers across all platforms. \"So sending a creator like me to an experience, I am engaging my followers to get that awareness.\" As the 2024 NFL season concludes, viewership and engagement among Generation Z and Generation Alpha has hit a record high, according to the NFL. Austin's role underscores a new reality where online creators are treated just like traditional celebrities, in an attempt to attract younger audiences to football. The NFL has made this push in partnership with social apps like YouTube and Snapchat, highlighting the league's evolving marketing strategies that are increasingly focused on digitally native audiences. \"You start to look at these different cohorts of fans, especially the ones that are a little more difficult to reach through linear and you start to see the role in which creators can play and broaden that audience,\" said Ian Trombetta, NFL senior vice president of social, influencer and creator marketing.\u00a0 For this year's Super Bowl, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, brands like Nike and EA are sponsoring creators to attend the event and post content. Austin didn't say how much she's getting paid for the content she's making at Super Bowl 59, but some brands have signed deals of up to six figures with some creators to promote the event, said Victoria Bachan, global president of Sixteenth, a creator talent management company. \"You can no longer really have a media strategy for tentpole opportunities like this that do not include a creator level,\" said Bachan. Brands are increasing their spending on influencer activations for this year's Super Bowl between 25% and 35%, and they're diverting funds from traditional TV-only advertising to do so, according to a study by Captiv8, an influencer marketing platform. The push for creators comes after concerns about younger audiences' lack of interest in sports had grown. A 2022 Emory Goizueta Business School study found that 27% of Gen Z identify as \"anti-sports,\" compared\u00a0with 7% of millennials and 5% of Generation X. The NFL's push to engage creators, which began in 2019, has already paid off. The percentage of Gen Z and Gen A who identify as fans has grown steadily for the last three years to an all-time high as the league's investment in creators has grown, according to the NFL. Besides Austin, Snapchat sent a handful of other creators to the Super Bowl to post behind-the-scenes content using augmented reality filters. Meanwhile, YouTube, which secured a $2 billion-per-year deal for the rights to \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" in 2022, has established itself as pivotal to connecting the league with digital audiences. This year, YouTube will debut as the first official sponsor of the Super Bowl Tailgate, which will\u00a0feature events with top creators like Kristy and Desmond Scott and a livestreamed performance by rapper Post Malone before the game on Sunday. To adapt to these changes, the NFL has eased up on restrictions around the use of official league footage by creators on their YouTube channels.\u00a0 The league and YouTube in January expanded their \"Access Pass\" program to allow retired NFL players like Cam Newton, Jason Kelce and Kurt Benkert to use league footage in their videos.\u00a0 \"There's this pathway now that certainly did not exist five to 10 years ago,\" Trombetta said. \"It's really cool especially as these athletes showcase more of their personalities off the field.\" WATCH: Meta the 'most consequential' company in the world: Futurum CEO Got a confidential news tip?

Shares of companies spanning the auto, industrial, retail and beverage industries with international supply chains were hit particularly hard. Trump on Saturday\u00a0slapped a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, while adding a 10% levy on imports from China. The president said Monday that he's pausing the Mexico tariffs for one month after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to immediately send 10,000 soldiers to her country's border to prevent drug trafficking. Trump also ramped up his tariff threats to the European Union. Tariffs could not only increase the cost of transporting goods across borders, they could also disrupt supply chains and crimp business confidence. Goldman Sachs warned that Trump's latest action could cause a 5% sell-off in U.S. stocks due to the hit to corporate earnings. Here are some of the most affected industries and stocks: These tariffs could have a material impact on the global automotive industry, which has a heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. Detroit's big three car makers \u2014 General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis \u2014 could feel the pain from disrupted supply chains as a result of tariffs and may be forced to shift production from foreign factories to the United States. Constellation Brands, a large importer of alcohol from Mexico, is leading a sell-off among booze stocks. Canada has threatened to pull American alcohol from its government-run liquor shelves in response to Trump's 25% tariffs. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill and avocado company Calavo Growers\u00a0could feel the pain from more costly supplies, as these companies import avocados from Mexico. Sportswear brands Nike and Lululemon could be vulnerable to Trump's tariffs because of their heavy reliance on Chinese imports, including fabrics. Their sizable business in China could also be hurt by the negative sentiment from the trade war. Discount retailers such as Five Below could be among the hardest hit businesses, as imports from China usually make up a significant portion of their sales. Dollar General shares initially sold off on tariff news but finished Monday in the green. Dollar General put its direct import percentage at 4% in 2023. Another victim could be Canada Goose, a Canada-based luxury outerwear firm. Tariffs could be damaging to railroad operators, as heavy duties could slow the flow of goods being transported to the U.S., hurting their revenue and profits. Union Pacific Corporation moves freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada and Mexico. Norfolk Southern and\u00a0Canadian Pacific Kansas City are also exposed to the tariffs. \u00a0 Trump's tariffs also\u00a0targeted a trade provision that helped fuel the explosive growth of budget online retailers, including Temu. The orders against China, Canada and Mexico all halt a trade exemption, known as \"de minimis,\" which allows exporters to ship packages worth less than $800 into the U.S. duty-free. PDD Holdings-owned Temu and\u00a0Alibaba's AliExpress may no longer be able to take advantage of the loophole to sell cheap apparel, household items and electronics. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Dollar General put its direct import percentage at 4% in 2023. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

The announcement came just days after Trump slapped a 10% tariff on imports from China, and came along with a slew of other retaliatory measures against the U.S., including new duties on energy imports and farm gear.\u00a0 \"There's this tit-for-tat trade war going on, and [China] wants to show the United States that it's going to take action to hurt either big U.S. companies or companies with significant interests in the U.S.,\" said Michael Kaye, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs, who has been practicing international trade law for more than 30 years. \"They're being made an example. ... My guess is, [China] wanted to pick somebody and they wanted it to be somebody that was high visibility.\" Now that PVH is on the unreliable entities list, China could force the company to shut down the dozens of stores that it operates in the region and forbid it from selling its wares to Chinese consumers online, said Kaye. Its staff \u2014 including those who've built lives in China \u2014 could be effectively deported and sent home, Kaye added. It is unclear if China would try to enforce actions against PVH in the autonomous region of Hong Kong, where the company's Asia-Pacific headquarters are.\u00a0In 2020, China passed a law that gave it more power to enforce national laws\u00a0in Hong Kong, and that is \"particularly the case with laws applicable to national security,\"\u00a0which could include the unreliable entities list,\u00a0said Kaye. As of Thursday morning Eastern time, the company appeared to be operating its business as usual in China. China could even prohibit PVH from manufacturing in the region altogether, which could force it to move production to other countries and struggle to meet customer orders.\u00a0 It's unclear which steps exactly China will take, or if the Trump administration will try to convince China not to punish the company. In a statement, PVH said that it was \"surprised and deeply disappointed to learn of the decision from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.\" \"In our 20 years of operating in China and proudly serving our consumers, as a matter of policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices.\u00a0We will continue our engagement with relevant authorities and look forward to a positive resolution,\" the company said. China represented 6% of PVH's sales and 16% of its earnings before interest and taxes in 2023, but it relies more heavily on the country for manufacturing, which is the bigger risk to its business. PVH has more factories and suppliers in China than in any other region, representing about 18% of production, according to a disclosure it issued in December.\u00a0 \"This has the potential to be very, very disruptive for PVH,\" said GlobalData managing director and retail analyst Neil Saunders. \"They would certainly have to scramble to find new capacity. They'd be able to do that in time, of course, but the two things that are at issue are that, because a lot of supply chains are just in time, they would probably find that they did get short on inventory whilst they made the transition. The other issue, of course, is quality.\"\u00a0 PVH has operated in China for more than 20 years, and while it works with suppliers and factories in more than 30 other countries, the higher-end goods that it makes can be difficult to manufacture elsewhere because of the skill level needed, said Saunders.\u00a0 \"While you can shift manufacturing capacity reasonably easily, it's not so easy to guarantee the quality, guarantee the production processes. Those things take time to upskill,\" said Saunders. \"China has that capacity and has those skills, because PVH has been operating there for ages. Another country, another manufacturing facility, may not have those skills immediately.\"\u00a0 Plus, PVH has viewed China as a growth market and it will now have to look for new strategies to increase sales and profitability as demand falls for its high-end dresses, intimate apparel and sweaters.\u00a0 China's unreliable entities list is a relatively new law in the country, and experts say it's deliberately opaque. The government has wide latitude to take action against PVH, but it remains unclear what exactly it will do. Typically, guidance comes within a few days of a company's placement on the blacklist, said Kaye.\u00a0 China could add PVH to the list and do nothing to the company, but Kaye said the chances of that are \"very slim\" because the government will want to avoid the perception that it's backing down. China will more likely use PVH as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table with Trump, and use it as an example to show the power it has to inflict pain on other U.S. businesses with major operations and customer bases in China, such as Nike, Apple, General Motors, Starbucks and others.\u00a0 \"There's a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over [PVH's] head, and that is exactly what this is, because this isn't really about PVH at all. This is about PVH being caught in the spat between China and the U.S.,\" said Saunders. \"China is using PVH as an example to say, look, if tariffs go ahead, if other restrictions are put in place on China, we can make life difficult for U.S. companies in the country. That's really what this is about.\" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

But that\u2019s especially true today because low-income families have been facing years of financial pressure due to a surge in the cost of living. Savings have vanished. Borrowing has spiked.\n     \n            \u201cUS households are already suffering from high costs. This is going to add insult to injury,\u201d Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in a phone interview.\n     \n            Trump tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would cost the typical household about $1,200 per year, Clausing and her colleague Mary Lovely found in a new analysis. The good news is that Trump\u2019s planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been delayed for a month. But the tariffs on China went into effect Tuesday morning, and China immediately retaliated with tariffs on US energy and metals.\n     \n            That burden falls disproportionately on those who can least afford it: The tariffs on America\u2019s biggest three trading partners will wipe out 2.7% of the income of the bottom 20% of earners, the Peterson Institute found.\n     \n            \u201cThat\u2019s a big hit if you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Clausing said.\n     \n            It\u2019s more than double the 1.2% of income that would get slashed from the income of the top 20% of earners.\n     \n            And the top 1% of earners would only lose 0.6% of their income, according to the Peterson Institute.\n     \n            Clausing explained this is in part because lower-income families typically save less and spend more of their paychecks on goods like groceries and furniture and less on tuition and other items that won\u2019t get impacted directly by tariffs.\n     \n            Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said lower and middle-income families will \u201cabsolutely\u201d get hit the hardest by tariffs.\n     \n            Daco said that the combination of falling savings, higher debt burdens and tariffs is a \u201cvery risky\u201d combination for the US economy. \u201cWe were already starting to see some cracks in the foundation of consumer spending,\u201d he said.\n     \n            One yellow light flashing on consumer spending is high debt levels.\n     \n            The share of active credit card accounts only making the minimum payment climbed to nearly 11% during the third quarter of 2024, according to new estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That\u2019s the highest since records began in 2012.\n     \n            The Philly Fed similarly found that a key delinquency rate on credit cards has more than doubled over the past three years.\n     \n            The fact that Canadian energy may only be getting tariffed at 10% \u2013 if they go into effect next month \u2013 could limit the upward pressure on gasoline prices, as well.\n     \n            Some of the retaliatory actions from China could shrink wages or even cause layoffs for manufacturers and farmworkers \u2014 including in red states that helped Trump win the 2024 election.\n     \n            Economists have cautioned that higher inflation from US tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could delay future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. That could keep borrowing costs on credit cards, car loans and other debt higher for longer, putting even more pressure on consumers.\n     \n            Some executives are worried that higher tariffs and higher prices will limit how much Americans are able or willing to shop.\n     \n            That\u2019s one reason Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, argues Trump\u2019s tariffs are \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cIf everything is more costly and consumers have less disposable income that\u2019s less money to buy shoes,\u201d Priest, whose trade group represents Nike, Crocs and other brands, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cIf you want to make a list of ways to drive up prices, this would be at the top of the list.\u201d\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It was part of a broad package of economic measures the Chinese government announced targeting the United States following President Donald Trump\u2019s implementation of 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports.\n     \n            A Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said Tuesday that it found PVH discriminated against and interfered with the operations of Chinese companies, though the spokesperson failed to provide specifics. China also added US biotech company Illumina to the blacklist.\n     \n            Being added to the \u201cunreliable entities\u201d list could bar PVH from doing business in China or lead to fines or other penalties, experts say.\n     \n            \u201cGoing after PVH is notable because it\u2019s the first time a consumer brand was targeted\u201d with the \u201cunreliable entity\u201d designation, said Sam Ide, a vice president who specializes in China at the Asia Group, a business consulting firm. Previously, the Chinese government had added US defense companies to the list.\n     \n            PVH criticized the decision and said it would work with Chinese authorities to resolve the situation.\n     \n            PVH, like all US retailers, prohibits direct or indirect sourcing from China\u2019s far western Xinjiang province. The US began banning all goods produced in the region during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration over forced labor concerns. Human rights groups say Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities have faced a raft of human rights abuses in the region, including being placed in mass internment camps.\n     \n            The Chinese government may be retaliating against the company for its refusal to source cotton from Xinjiang, which has been linked to forced labor of Uyghur minorities. In September, Beijing said it was investigating PVH for \u201cviolating normal market transaction principles\u201d by boycotting cotton sourced from Xinjiang.\n     \n            China has described the facilities as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d and claimed in 2019 that such centers had been closed. Officials have consistently denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\n     \n            PVH has a \u201csignificant enough China presence, but it also wasn\u2019t going to have big economic ramifications,\u201d Ide said.\n     \n            It\u2019s not clear why the Chinese government targeted PVH specifically, but Ide noted PVH \u201cchecks a few boxes\u201d and the company isn\u2019t as big as Nike or other popular US brands in China, so there would be fewer job losses and less of a fallout if PVH shut down in the country.\n     \n            Restrictions on PVH\u2019s business in China would be a blow to the company.\n     \n            In 2023, China contributed 6% of PVH\u2019s revenue and 16% of its profit. Calvin Klein has a physical presence in virtually every Chinese province.\n     \n            \u201cChina is an important growth engine,\u201d PVH CEO Stefan Larsson said on an earnings call in April. \u201cWe continue to focus on driving overall brand awareness, especially in China, where both Calvin and Tommy are under-penetrated.\u201d\n     \nCNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Simone McCarthy contributed to this article.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Their products are among some of the most commonplace and critical items used by Americans, including fruits and vegetables, meat, gas, automobiles, electronics, toys, clothing, lumber, and beer and spirits.\n     \n            Mexico and Canada supply a significant share of several key food categories. For example, Mexico is the largest supplier of fruit and vegetables to the US, while Canada leads in exports of grain, livestock and meats, poultry and more.\n     \n            Agricultural products from Mexico and Canada, in particular, could become more expensive for consumers, as grocery retailers operate on thinner profit margins than most industries. With little room to absorb higher tariff costs, the grocers may have to pass them on to shoppers.\n     \n            Although the US typically exports more agricultural goods than it imports, the value of imports has increased faster than that of exports in the past decade, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Additionally, climate change has increased US reliance on countries like Mexico, where growing conditions are more favorable.\n     \n            Last year, the US imported $46 billion of agricultural products from Mexico, according to USDA data. That includes $8.3 billion worth of fresh vegetables, $5.9 billion of beer and $5 billion of distilled spirits.\n     \n            But the biggest category of agricultural imports from Mexico last year was fresh fruits, of which the US imported $9 billion worth, with avocados accounting for $3.1 billion of that total.\n     \n            The US imported $97 billion worth of oil and gas from Canada last year, that country\u2019s top export to the US. The US has become more reliant on Canadian oil since the expansion of Canada\u2019s Trans Mountain pipeline, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.\n     \n            The tariff on Canadian energy products is only 10%, not the 25% tariff announced on other Canadian exports.\n     \n             That\u2019ll limit the impact on gasoline prices, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n     \n            Another factor is the time of year. Gas prices are typically near a low for the year in February due to weak demand. If the tariffs stay in place through summer, the impact will be greater, he said.\n     \n            And while the impact isn\u2019t expected to be felt equally nationwide, it likely will hit America\u2019s Heartland the hardest.\n     \n            Most Canadian oil is shipped to Midwest refineries via pipeline, Kloza said. The states most likely to be affected are Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin, he said.\n     \n            \u201cInterestingly, 12 of those 16 states begin February with an average retail gasoline price under $3 a gallon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat probably won\u2019t last.\u201d\n     \n            The US imported $87 billion worth of motor vehicles and $64 billion worth of vehicle parts from Mexico last year, not accounting for December, the top two goods imported from there that year, according to Commerce Department data. (December trade data is due out next week.)\n     \n            Motor vehicles were also the second-largest good the US imported from Canada last year through November, for a total of $34 billion.\n     \n            The auto sector is likely \u201capoplectic\u201d about the new potential tariffs, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. US car companies have been able to keep production costs down by hiring lower-wage workers, particularly in Mexico, where much of their production has shifted to in recent years.\n     \n            But that cost saving will essentially be erased if there\u2019s a 25% tariff, she said. Car manufacturers are unlikely to move their production elsewhere, given they\u2019ve made sizable investments in existing plants in both countries and it is difficult to source all the raw materials to build cars and their parts from other places.\n     \n            While the United States is not the manufacturing-focused economy it once was, it still consumes tens of millions of tons of steel a year, feeding industries such as automaking, oil production, construction and infrastructure.\n     \n            Canada and Mexico are the largest and third-largest exporters of steel to the United States, respectively. In his first term, President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel imports from most nations worldwide effective June 2018. But Mexico and Canada, under their free trade deals with the United States, were exempt from those tariffs.\n     \n            Canada now accounts for nearly a quarter of steel imported by American businesses by weight, while Mexico accounts for about 12%, according to government data provided by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group.\n     \n            However, there is empirical evidence showing that the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum did raise prices, Won Sohn said, noting a 2020 Federal Reserve study that found an increase in producer prices, which eventually were passed along to consumers.\n     \n            Beer and liquor may be recession-proof, but they\u2019re certainly not tariff-proof.\n     \n            The result would be a stiff penalty on some of America\u2019s favorite libations, including tequila, which can be made only in Mexico and the No. 1 beer brand in the nation, Modelo.\n     \nConstellation Brands, which imports Modelo and Corona beer as well as Casa Noble tequila from Mexico, could see its costs leap 16% under Trump\u2019s proposed tariff and would likely have to raise prices by about 4.5%, Chris Carey, a Wells Fargo equity analyst, wrote in a November note.\n     \n            In 2023, the US imported $5.69 billion of beer and $4.81 billion of alcohol from Mexico, according to International Trade Administration data. When combined, the two categories were the 10th-biggest import from Mexico last year and mark a sharp 126% increase from 2017, International Trade Administration data shows.\n     \n            While the tariffs could cause further increases in key materials (such as steel, aluminum and grain) for US beer and spirits businesses, the industry is also bracing for the potential of retaliatory tariffs.\n     \n            Softwood lumber, which is sourced from the likes of pine, spruce, firs and other conifers is prized for its light weight, workability and strength.\n     \n            As such, its applications are vast, but it\u2019s a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry: Commonly, the skeleton and skin of homes \u2014 the framing, roof and siding \u2014 consist of softwood lumber.\n     \n            And 30% of what the US uses annually comes from Canada.\n     \n            Economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that taxing \u2014 or worse, cutting off \u2014 Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.\n     \n            \u201cWhether it\u2019s lumber tariffs or tariffs on any other import, these can impact the supply chain,\u201d said Nick Erickson, senior director of housing policy for Housing First Minnesota, a trade organization that represents builders, remodelers and other businesses in the North Star State. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen in the past that tariffs on lumber, these are paid for by new homebuyers in the cost of their home.\u201d\n     \n            And it\u2019s not just lumber at risk for tariffs: 71% of the imported $456 million of lime and gypsum (which are used for drywall) came from Mexico in 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n     \n            Factoring in the other raw materials and components imported from Canada, Mexico, as well as China (notably the steel, aluminum and home appliances already subject to tariffs), Trump\u2019s new tariffs could raise the cost of imported construction materials by $3 billion to $4 billion, the NAHB noted.\n     \n            Consumer electronics are among the top goods the US imported from China last year, according to federal trade data. That includes cellphones, TVs, laptops, video game consoles, monitors and all the components that power them.\n     \n            China also is a major supplier of home appliances. Those along with toys and footwear are   particularly exposed to Trump\u2019s tariff threats.\n     \n            A staggering 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands.\n     \n            More than half (56%) of shoes sold in the United States are made in China, the trade group said.\n     \n            The United States is also reliant on China for toys and sporting equipment, including items such as footballs, soccer balls and baseballs. The United States gets 75% of its imported toys and sports equipment from China.\n     \n  CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore, David Goldman, Matt Egan, and Annette Choi contributed to this report.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "Summary": "Markets \n\n\n Hot Stocks \n\n\n Fear & Greed Index \n\n\n \n            Latest Market News \n\n\n \n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n \n            President Donald Trump says he will impose his tariffs over the weekend, gambling that taxing American companies for imported goods will ultimately punish the countries that make stuff Americans want \u2014 and bring those nations to the negotiating table. But it\u2019s a risky bet that could easily backfire on American consumers and the economy.\n     \n            In the United States, tariffs typically serve a limited but important purpose: They are intended to grow America\u2019s economy by incentivizing the purchase of made-in-the-USA goods. They accomplish that by effectively penalizing American companies that buy foreign goods with high taxes.\n     \n            Economists largely believe that, in limited circumstances, tariffs can be effective tools for economic growth. But Trump believes that tariffs have an altogether different purpose.\n     \n            Trump has long praised tariffs as effective economic policy. On Monday, Trump called \u201ctariff\u201d the fourth-most beautiful word in the dictionary, behind \u201cGod,\u201d \u201clove\u201d and \u201creligion.\u201d\n     \n            And Trump has repeatedly (and incorrectly) said that \u201cthe tariff sheriff,\u201d former President William McKinley, ushered in an era of American prosperity at the end of the 19th century by going all-in on tariffs. Though the US economy was growing strong in the 1890s, that was largely on the back of practically unrestricted immigration, among other factors.\n     \n            Still, Trump has used and promised to employ tariffs for three primary purposes: to raise revenue, to bring trade into balance and to bring rival countries to the negotiating table.\n     \n            America is running massive deficits, and Trump\u2019s tax cut plan could put the budget even deeper in the hole. Trump has said the tariffs will make up for lost revenue: He predicted last week in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum that the tariffs would bring in hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 perhaps trillions of dollars \u2014 into the US Treasury.\n     \n            Trump routinely criticizes American trade policy for \u201csubsidizing\u201d Canada and Mexico, saying America is \u201closing\u201d hundreds of billions of dollars to its neighboring nations. Trump is imprecisely talking about the trade gap, the difference between what America exports and imports. Some economists caution that Trump\u2019s language about America\u2019s trade gap presents an unfair representation of what has become a crucial mechanism for the US economy \u2014 its ability to purchase services offered by other countries as well as stuff that isn\u2019t made here much, like coffee.\n     \n            And Trump likes tariffs because they can force countries to give up something he believes is in America\u2019s best interest. Although tariffs are charged to importers, they can dissuade buyers from purchasing goods from tariffed countries, hurting those nations\u2019 economies. That has led some of them to seek agreements to avoid tariffs. Trump has said he wants Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States. And for China, Trump has said tariffs would be aimed at forcing the country to make good on what he said was a stated promise to him that the government would execute people caught sending fentanyl to the United States.\n     \n            Trump and his administration have been consistent: Tariffs in some form are coming on Saturday. But they\u2019ve offered conflicting information about what tariffs would be announced this weekend.\n     \n            During an Oval Office signing ceremony on his first day in office, Trump said he would impose 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico and Canada on February 1. The next day he said he would place a 10% tariff on all goods from China on February 1. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Wednesday that February 1 was when tariffs would go into effect. And again on Thursday from the Oval Office, Trump said his administration will be announcing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Saturday. Friday, Leavitt rebutted a Reuters report that suggested tariffs could be delayed, stating that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China would be put in place Saturday.\n     \n            But Trump at an address to House Republicans on Monday spelled out specific items that his administration would tariff \u2014 rather than across-the-board tariffs \u2014 including pharmaceuticals, microchips and steel. Confusingly, earlier that day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was pushing for a plan to begin with a 2.5% tariff on all goods and gradually increase them, according to the Financial Times. But Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he would reject that plan, saying \u201cthat would not be acceptable to me,\u201d saying tariffs needed to be \u201cmuch, much bigger.\u201d\n     \n            There\u2019s widespread doubt on Wall Street that Trump will rush to put into effect those massive tariffs in full force on Saturday. To enact tariffs, Trump will probably declare a national economic emergency, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as \u201cIEEPA,\u201d which unilaterally authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency, CNN has previously reported. But Chris Krueger, an analyst at TD Securities, noted that Trump has not yet triggered the IEEPA statute and is running out of time to get that done for Saturday\u2019s promised tariffs.\n     \n            If not Saturday \u2014 or if some limited tariffs go in place Saturday \u2014 more severe tariffs could be put in place later this year. Trump\u2019s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, hinted at a second wave of tariffs against Mexico and Canada that could come in the spring \u2014 perhaps April. He suggested that the initial tariffs, coming as soon as Saturday, are \u201caction-oriented\u201d tariffs aimed at reducing fentanyl and illegal immigrants coming over the US border.\n     \n            And he said those action-oriented tariffs may be avoided altogether: \u201cAs far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\u201d Lutnick said Wednesday at his confirmation hearing. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, then there will be.\u201d\n     \n            Canada has been hoping to avoid tariffs by doing just that, working with the United States and pledging Wednesday to stand up a \u201cstrike force\u201don fentanyl to hit drug traffickers \u201charder and faster,\u201d deploying two Black Hawk helicopters, 60 drones and new specially trained canine teams at the border.\n     \n            Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said Wednesday she was hopeful to avoid tariffs after her meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but she acknowledged that no one knows what will happen February 1 \u2014 only the president, she said.\n     \n            But Canada is also preparing to retaliate against tariffs, if necessary. Canadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada, targeting items that both send a political message and inflict a reasonable amount of economic damage, two sources said, including ceramic products, steel products, furniture, certain alcoholic beverages like Bourbon and Jack Daniels whiskey, orange juice and pet food, among other goods.\n     \n            The second kind of tariff, which Lutnick said would be \u201cordinary tariffs,\u201d could be executed after a study on the macroeconomic effects of levying import taxes on America\u2019s neighbors. That study will be concluded by April, as mandated by an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office, Lutnick said.\n     \n            Trump has also proposed 10% tariffs on all other goods coming into America, though he said last week his administration wasn\u2019t ready to implement those just yet. And he proposed tariffs on Denmark to incentivize it to give control of Greenland to the United States. (He has also threatened to use military force to take Greenland.) Trump on Thursday said that goods from BRICS nations \u2014 a coalition of emerging economies backed by China and Russia \u2014 would face 100% tariffs if they attempted to move away from the US dollar in international trade.\n     \n            Importantly, Trump has a history of threatening tariffs, only to later rescind them. Last week, for example, he announced steep tariffs on Colombia in retaliation for failing to accept US miliary planes with deportees. Ten hours later, he said the tariffs would not go in place after Colombia reversed its stance.\n     \n            In 2019, Trump threatened a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports that would rise to 25% if Mexico declined to take action to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border with the United States. But after Mexican officials traveled to Washington for a week of in-person negotiations \u2014 and an agreement was reached to reinstate the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d immigration policy \u2014 the tariffs were never implemented.\n     \n            If Trump follows through with limited tariffs, he has said they\u2019d be focused on pharmaceuticals, steel and computer chips. Trump on Thursday said oil might not be part of any tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and his administration would make that determination as early as Thursday night.\n     \n            But if tariffs are broader, that could raise prices on many common purchases, because Mexico, China and Canada are America\u2019s top trading partners. Some prices could rise quite quickly.\n     \n            For example, because most American cars are partially made in Mexico and Canada, the tariffs would add a minimum of thousands of dollars to the cost of cars, according to experts.\n     \n            Gas, food and alcohol prices would also rise if Trump imposed Canadian and Mexican tariffs.\n     \n            Sneaker prices would rise if Trump raised tariffs on China: About 99% of shoes sold in the United States are imported, mostly from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents Nike, Steve Madden, Cole Haan and other footwear brands. America also gets the vast majority of its electronics from there.\n     \n            Tariffs in certain circumstances do not cause inflation problems. Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs did not meaningfully raise inflation, although they were far narrower in scope than what Trump is currently proposing, and the pandemic that follow skewed some of the inflationary aspects of the tariffs \u2014 many of which remained in place during the Biden administration.\n     \n            But mainstream economists largely agree that tariffs cause inflation. That\u2019s because importers \u2014 not the countries exporting the goods \u2014 pay the tax, and they typically pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices. New research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff campaign will force American consumers to pay more for practically everything \u2014 from foreign-made sneakers and toys to food.\n     \n            They also can lead to trade wars. China, Europe and Canada, for example, retaliated against America with their own tariffs on particular items after the first Trump administration levied tariffs on certain items from those nations.\n     \n            Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could add $272 billion a year to tax burdens, according to Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions. The Peterson Institute has estimated Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household over $2,600 a year.\n \n            Still, some proponents of Trump\u2019s plan say the risk is worth the reward. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, last week told CNBC that if tariffs cause a little inflation but address a national security issue, then people should \u201cget over it.\u201d\n \n            Lutnick echoed those remarks Wednesday.\n     \n            \u201cIf Canada is going to rely on America for its economic growth, how about you treat our farmers, our ranchers and our fishermen with respect?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think the president and our Trump administration is focused on improving the lives of our producers.\u201d\n     \n            In the end, Lutnick argued tariffs mean \u201cthe economy of the United States will be much, much better.\u201d\n     \n  CNN\u2019s Matt Egan, Elisabeth Buchwald, Alicia Wallace, Kayla Tausche and Paula Newton contributed reporting.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
